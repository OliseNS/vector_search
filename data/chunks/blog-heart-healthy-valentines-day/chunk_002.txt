Refer to your dietitian for guidance on including these foods in your diet. Omega-3 fatty acids, shown to lower the risk of heart disease, are found in foods rich in polyunsaturated fats like salmon, tuna, flaxseeds, and fish oil supplements. When choosing to buy a fish oil supplement, make sure it includes DHA and EPA omega-3 fatty acids – these two compounds have been shown to decrease inflammation and even reduce your risk of heart disease. Please refer to your physician before starting a supplement. Decrease Your Intake of Saturated and Trans-Fats Diets that are high in saturated and trans-fats have been shown to increase LDL “bad” cholesterol and reduce HDL “good” cholesterol, which can increase your risk of heart disease and stroke. There is some debate around the nutritional value of saturated fats, but overall, research shows that limiting our intake of saturated fat is best. Foods high in saturated fat include butter, red meat, whole milk, cheese, ice cream, and tropical oils like coconut and palm. Trans-fats are a different story and should be consumed minimally. Foods high in trans fat include margarine, fried foods, vegetable shortening, highly processed foods, and baked goods.
