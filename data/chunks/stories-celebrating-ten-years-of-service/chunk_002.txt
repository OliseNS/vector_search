I was introduced to dialysis as an intern at the Joliet clinic. At the time, I was studying to become a medical assistant. People ask me what drew me to work in dialysis care. It was a variety of work. I could work as a medical assistant and in other office departments. This variety has helped me advance my skills professionally over the last ten years. The more I learn, the better I can understand and care for our patients. My passion and growing experience helped me advance from Medical Assistant to Dialysis Access Specialist, the position I hold today. While working in dialysis care has unique challenges, I have never stopped being an enthusiastic champion for my patients. The most important thing I can provide is a familiar face to patients, so they know they are not going through the treatment alone. Showing patients they have a support system behind them is one of the most rewarding aspects of the job. Reflecting on my ten years with KCC and DCC, I realize it has been quite a journey.
