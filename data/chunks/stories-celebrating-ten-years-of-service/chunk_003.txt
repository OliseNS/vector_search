Showing patients they have a support system behind them is one of the most rewarding aspects of the job. Reflecting on my ten years with KCC and DCC, I realize it has been quite a journey. The family culture that initially drew me to the company ten years ago is still an integral part of my work today. I take pride in working for a company that celebrates employees with different cultures, backgrounds, and experiences. Working with a diverse group of people is what makes DCC feel like a family.
