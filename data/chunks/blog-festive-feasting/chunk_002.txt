Appetizers: The serving size of your appetizer should be smaller than your palm. Remember that potassium, phosphorus, and sodium are the hidden ingredients in many appetizers. Be mindful and limit appetizers. Here are some alternatives to typical appetizers. Raw Veggies: Peppers, carrots, cucumbers, radishes & celery sticks Low Potassium Fruits: Grapes, apples, berries Snacks: Deviled eggs, unsalted popcorn, unsalted pretzels Spreads: Pineapple salsa, cream cheese, low-sodium cheese Main Course: Portion control! The amount of meat/protein eaten should be the size of the palm of your hand or as much as a deck of cards. Fill half of your plate with preferred non-starchy vegetables. Starches should be no bigger than the size of your computer mouse. If using gravy, use no more than 2 tablespoons on your plate. Protein: Turkey, pork, chicken, duck Vegetables: Green salad, green beans, corn, zucchini, cauliflower Starches: White rice, noodles, white bread or rolls, “leached” potatoes, couscous Sides: Cranberry sauce, applesauce, low-sodium gravy Liquids: Reminder for your fluid intake: anything liquid at room temperature is a fluid, not just plain water.
