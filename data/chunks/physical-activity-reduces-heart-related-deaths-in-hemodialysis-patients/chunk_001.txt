These results came from a new study on 6147 European and Argentinian patients receiving hemodialysis. The study defined physical activity as participating in activities like work, household chores, travel, or leisure. Heart-related deaths included sudden death, heart attack, atherosclerotic heart disease, cardiac arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, valvular heart disease, pulmonary edema, and congestive heart failure. Occasional physical activity was associated with a 20% lower risk for overall deaths and an 18% lower risk for heart-related deaths.
