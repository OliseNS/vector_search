Following these tips can help you lower your risk of getting heart disease or help keep heart disease from progressing. Control Blood Sugars if You Have Diabetes Monitor your blood sugar levels regularly as per your doctor’s recommendation. Sticking to your prescribed treatment plan, which includes taking medications, following a healthy diet, and engaging in physical activity, is essential. Control High Blood Pressure Take all your blood pressure medications as prescribed. Keeping your blood pressure readings in a notebook or treatment log is also essential. Maintain sodium (no more than 2000 mg/day) and fluid restriction (32-48 oz/day). Reduce High Cholesterol Levels Have the following labs checked annually: total cholesterol, HDL “good” cholesterol, LDL “bad” cholesterol, and triglycerides. If your levels are not in a healthy range, follow a low-fat diet, increase exercise, and ask about cholesterol-lowering medication if necessary. Follow a Heart-Healthy Diet Eat foods low in saturated fats, sodium, and phosphorus (less than 200 mg per serving). Include more foods high in heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, walnuts, flaxseeds, soybeans, and canola oil. Increase Physical Activity if Your Physician Allows Start slowly and aim to increase exercise to at least 30 minutes most days a week.
