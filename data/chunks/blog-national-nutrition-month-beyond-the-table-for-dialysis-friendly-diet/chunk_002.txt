This theme also includes sustainability, for instance, decreasing food waste from school and work to home and beyond. Here is how you can ensure that your dialysis-friendly diet incorporates sustainable practices and reduces food waste. Farm-to-Fork Journey of Nutrition: Explore local farmers’ markets: These markets often offer fresh, locally sourced produce. Supporting local farmers also promotes sustainable food practices. Start a small garden: Even if it’s just a few pots on a windowsill, growing your herbs or vegetables can help you understand and appreciate the effort put into food production. Choose seasonal produce: It’s often fresher and more nutritious and supports local agriculture. Various Ways We Eat: Practice mindful eating: Whether at home, school, or work, focus on the flavors and textures of your food. Pack nutritious snacks: If you’re on the go, plan ahead with healthy snacks like kidney-friendly fruits, or crackers. Choose healthier restaurant options: Look for dishes with lean proteins, kidney-friendly vegetables, and grains. Ask for dressings and sauces on the side.
