Meditation can be practiced anywhere, whether walking around your clinic or while sitting in the break room. By engaging in meditation, you can minimize negative emotions, enhance your self-awareness, reduce stress, and improve focus. Connect with colleagues: You can easily feel isolated and disconnected in a fast-paced healthcare environment. However, connecting with colleagues is a crucial self-care practice that can help reduce stress, provide emotional support, and increase motivation. Attend team meetings, share a meal, or take a few minutes to chat during a break. Seek opportunities for collaboration and support to build relationships and stay committed to your work.
