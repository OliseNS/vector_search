Home hemodialysis With home hemodialysis (HD), you are connected via a needle in your access site to an artificial kidney (dialyzer) that filters your blood. Opting for home-based treatment gives you the flexibility to schedule your prescribed treatments according to your daily activities. Treating at home eliminates the need to travel to a treatment center, saving travel time and transportation expenses. Peritoneal dialysis Home peritoneal dialysis (PD) involves using the peritoneum and the lining of your abdomen to filter your blood. Unlike other forms of dialysis, PD does not require needles, and your blood remains inside your body throughout the process. One of the advantages of PD is its flexibility, allowing you to perform treatments in various settings such as your home, workplace, or even while traveling. Initiating PD at an early stage may contribute to preserving any remaining kidney function. Frequently asked questions Who pays for dialysis? Private insurance usually covers dialysis and other treatment for kidney failure. If you donâ€™t have private insurance, most people who need dialysis or a transplant can qualify for Medicare, even under 65 years old. Different plans cover dialysis, like HMOs, Healthcare exchanges, Medicaid, and programs from the state or local government.
