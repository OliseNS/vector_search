Myth: I need to limit fruits and vegetables because of potassium. Fact: Even those who need to limit potassium need plenty of fruits and vegetables. Remember that less potassium is absorbed from plant-based foods than from meat-based or overly processed foods. Fiber may also improve bowel regularity to increase overall potassium excretion and improve acidosis, which is a condition where body fluids have too much acid. Acidosis can cause kidney disease to progress more quickly, increased bone loss or osteoporosis, and muscle loss Myth: Salt substitutes are safer than salt. Fact: Too much sodium can cause high blood pressure, discomfort during dialysis, and fluid buildup around the heart and lungs. Salt substitutes contain potassium chloride. This could be dangerous, especially if you need to limit how much potassium you eat. If you choose low-sodium or any salt-free seasoning blends, always look at the label and choose ones without potassium chloride. Always check with your dietitian to see if it is okay to use. Myth: I don’t put salt in my food, so I don’t need to worry about sodium. Fact: Sodium is found in many foods other than your saltshaker.
