The recommended total fluid intake in 24 hours for most people on dialysis is 1,000 mL (4 8oz cups) per day, plus the amount of urine output. Your dietitian will recommend how much to limit your fluid intake each day. Your doctor, dietitian, and nurse will also regularly evaluate your fluid balance and adjust the amount of fluid allowed each day based on your needs.
