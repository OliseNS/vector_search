Here’s a simple breakdown of what to expect: The surgeon makes a surgical cut in your lower abdomen. The donor kidney is connected to your blood vessels and bladder. In most cases, your old kidneys are left in place unless they’re causing issues. Once everything is connected, the new kidney usually starts working right away, but in some cases, it may take a few days. After surgery, you’ll be taken to a recovery room, where your vitals, fluid levels, and kidney function will be closely monitored.

During this time, your medical team will: Monitor your new kidney’s function Manage your pain Watch for signs of infection or organ rejection Begin your post-transplant medication plan From now on, immunosuppressants will become a permanent part of your daily routine.
