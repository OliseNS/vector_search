Expanded dialysis is a new treatment method that can remove a broader range of toxins from the body than conventional dialysis. This study was conducted for three months with 28 patients. The new dialyzer used in the study has precisely made pores that allow larger-sized toxic chemicals to be filtered from the blood as well while retaining essential molecules such as albumin.
