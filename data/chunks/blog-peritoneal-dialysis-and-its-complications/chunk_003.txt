Common Complications of Peritoneal Dialysis The most significant and commonly reported complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheters is an infection called Peritonitis. It is an infection of the abdominal cavityâ€™s lining (peritoneum). This infection can also develop where the tube (catheter) is inserted into the body to carry the cleansing fluid into and out of your belly. Weight gain. The dialysate contains sugar (dextrose). Absorbing some dialysates might even cause you to take in hundreds of extra calories daily. This can easily lead to weight gain. The extra calories you are getting can also cause high blood sugar, especially for those with diabetes. Holding fluid in your abdomen for extended time periods may even strain your muscles. Inadequate Dialysis. Peritoneal Dialysis can become ineffective after several years. You might need to switch to hemodialysis. Protocols are in place to decrease the infection risk in PD patients and prevent complications of peritoneal dialysis. These include proper catheter placement, exit-site care including Staphylococcus aureus prophylaxis, careful training of patients with periodic re-training, prevention of contamination, and prevention of procedure-related and fungal peritonitis.
