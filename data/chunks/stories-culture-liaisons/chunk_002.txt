These liaisons champion the importance of patient feedback, develop initiatives to boost patient satisfaction, and work hand in hand with the staff to address any grievances or complaints. Meet Tami Foltys, an esteemed member of the DCC family for over four years. Recently appointed as the Cultural Care Liaison in February 2023, Tami brings a wealth of knowledge from her background in psychology. “Empathy is key,” she asserts. With a genuine desire to understand the DCC patients and empathize with them, Tami believes that forging strong relationships with them can significantly impact their perception of the clinics and their treatments. Going above and beyond for the patients, “If a specific patient wants to see or speak with me, I personally visit them at the clinic.” Tami finds immense gratification in knowing she is making a difference and building trust between herself and the patients she serves. Another exceptional member of the DCC team is Alfonso Stephens, the patient liaison responsible for out-of-state clinics. With eight years of experience in the healthcare field, Alfonso recognizes the power of acknowledging patient feedback. He prioritizes visiting clinic floors, directly engaging with patients, and listening to their concerns.
