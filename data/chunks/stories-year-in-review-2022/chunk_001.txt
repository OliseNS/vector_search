In 2022, we opened four new clinics: DCC Vollmer, DCC Brooksville, DCC Camp Hill Home, and DCC Taylor. With each new DCC clinic opened, we provide our patients the opportunity to receive the best care available and the DCC family the chance to continuously contribute to the communities we serve. In 2022, DCC committed to continuing to connect with the people in the communities we serve. DCC has hosted and participated in many community events to bring awareness to renal diseases.
