The main difference between staff-assisted dialysis and home dialysis is who performs the treatment. With staff-assisted home dialysis, someone else helps you with the treatment. However, with home dialysis, you will need to learn to do the treatment yourself eventually. Initially, you will receive training from a medical professional on administering the treatment. The training will also include advice about keeping records of your treatment. After completing the necessary training, you will be responsible for conducting the dialysis treatment on your own in the case of home dialysis. On the other hand, with staff-assisted home dialysis, you wonâ€™t need to perform the treatment by yourself.Instead, a licensed nurse will do it for you every visit.
