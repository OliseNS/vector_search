The teamwork between the different departments is something Walters enjoys about working at DCC. On her team, Walters said, “It is nice to have a team that will be there for you and pick up slack when you need it. And I will help anyone who needs my help; that’s what teammates do.” Upon reflection on her career in dialysis, Walters has advice for anyone interested in becoming a PCT: “Hang in there; there are going to be many new things you will need to learn to be successful, but learn it and learn it well.” Dialysis Care Center AL AK AZ AR CA CO CT DE FL GA HI ID IL IN IA KS KY LA ME MD MA MI MN MS MO MT NE NV NH NJ NM NY NC ND OH OK OR PA RI SC SD TN TX UT VT VA WA WV WI WY DC Explore LocationsServicesDCC CaresEventsNews Useful Links CareersMy DCCPartnersContact UsBlogsPay My Bill DCC Customer Care Center 708-713-5080 Useful Links Locations | Services | DCC Care | Careers | Contact Us Admissions 844-466-3436 309-808-4352 admissions@dccdialysis.com​ Admissions: 844-466-3436 309-808-4352 admissions@dccdialysis.com​ This site is for informational purposes only and is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis or treatment.© 2025.
