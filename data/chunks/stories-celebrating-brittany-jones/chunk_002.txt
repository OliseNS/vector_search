She had firsthand experience with her Dad being on dialysis. As a mother, daughter, and medical staff personnel, she empathizes with dialysis patients and would love to give her patients a better outlook on life. In-Center Clinic Work Brittany works with DCC Lebanon and DCC Hershey simultaneously. She emphasizes that organization and consistent communication are critical to an efficient and productive team. Through educating staff and patients, the clinics can stay on top of treatments and the patientâ€™s health, which is a top priority. Accomplishments Her pride stems from achieving healthy hemoglobin levels for all her patients, a challenging accomplishment she finally realized in August 2023 and considers this because of a team effort. This achievement is tangible evidence that diligent effort and unwavering dedication yield meaningful results. With DCC Lebanon being a newer clinic, initially, getting every detail in order was hard. She is proud to say that with the help of Jacqueline Jeffers, Area Manager, and many others, DCC Lebanon has been state-certified.
