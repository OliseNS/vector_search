With DCC Lebanon being a newer clinic, initially, getting every detail in order was hard. She is proud to say that with the help of Jacqueline Jeffers, Area Manager, and many others, DCC Lebanon has been state-certified. This gives the population more options with DCC Hershey and DCC Lebanon. Patients’ Lives Brittany’s foremost objective is to ensure that her patients continue to have an improved quality of life. She understands that dialysis is hard and in-center dialysis takes extra accommodations, and this can be daunting to patients. Brittany recounts a specific instance where she had a patient undergoing in-center dialysis who was on the verge of giving up. This was a compelling incentive to help improve the patient’s mental well-being. Brittany provided consistent support throughout the treatment process, ensuring timely medication administration. Eventually, she transitioned the patient to home dialysis, significantly enhancing his perspective on the dialysis experience. She is determined to ensure that where there’s a will, there’s a way for her patients. Home dialysis offers patients a sense of having more time for their daily activities. The PD census shows that DCC Hershey has the highest rating for patients to receive a transplant in the area.
