Thanksgiving welcomes us, allowing us to reconnect with our loved ones. Since the holiday is food-centric, navigating as a dialysis patient can be daunting. “What should I eat? What should I avoid? How do I communicate my needs without feeling like a burden?” If you’ve asked yourself any of these questions, you will find solutions below to avoid the holiday pitfalls. Don’t stress; we’re here to help you enjoy the food and loved ones you love. Although they may need a little education, you will often find that your loved ones support your needs and want to provide food that everyone, including you, can enjoy. If you are attending Thanksgiving dinner, it may be a good idea to cook one or two kidney-friendly dishes that you know you will be able to eat. Ask your host what they plan to serve beforehand so that you can help fill in the gaps with your favorite dishes. Show your loved ones that kidney-friendly foods can be healthy and delicious, so bring enough to share! Always remember the importance of portion control. Just because a dish isn’t kidney-friendly doesn’t mean you must avoid it altogether.
