You can make these items from scratch at home to decrease the phosphorus content. Make sure to bring and take your phosphorus binders with you for your meal. Talk to your doctor or dietitian about taking an extra binder with your big meal; this would help cover the excess food or phosphorus you may consume. Watching what we consume does not only apply to the foods we choose but also to the drinks. Some great holiday favorites include lemon-lime soda, ginger ale, Fresca, club soda, cranberry, apple, and grapes juices. If you have diabetes, be sure to watch your sugar levels and opt for lower-sugar or sugar-free varieties. Be careful to stay within your fluid recommendations, typically between 32 and 48 ounces per day. Make sure to speak with your dietitian regarding any questions you may have. We at Dialysis Care Center wish you and your family a very joyous and healthy holiday season!
