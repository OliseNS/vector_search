Show your loved ones that kidney-friendly foods can be healthy and delicious, so bring enough to share! Always remember the importance of portion control. Just because a dish isn’t kidney-friendly doesn’t mean you must avoid it altogether. Proper portion control can help you keep yourself in check, allow a little leeway, and prevent you from derailing your usual diet. Some commonly consumed Thanksgiving foods can be high in phosphorus and potassium – macaroni and cheese, gravy, yams, sweet potatoes, and mashed potatoes, to name a few. If you decide to indulge in any foods you know may not be the best for you, limit your portions to less than ½ cup and try to avoid seconds and thirds. Be mindful of canned and processed foods – boxed stuffing, cranberry sauce, gravy mixes, fried meats, powdered mashed potatoes, and premade desserts – as these foods can be high in phosphorus and phosphorus additives. You can make these items from scratch at home to decrease the phosphorus content. Make sure to bring and take your phosphorus binders with you for your meal.
