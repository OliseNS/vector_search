Throughout her time at DCC, Andrea always advocated to patients the importance of adjusting positively to life on dialysis and working hard to maintain their new lifestyles. She worked extensively with her co-worker Kim Birdsong to help educate patients on the importance of not missing dialysis treatments. Regarding Andrea’s talents, Birdsong said, “Working with patients is where Andrea’s talents were best exhibited, and she was always happy to share her experiences.” As an organ recipient, Andrea’s unique perspective helped her relate to patients personally. Social Worker Manager Dawn Gromley says that Andrea could relate to her patients in a way not everyone can. Andrea’s openness about her experiences made her a vital part of the team. Gromley also says that although Andrea’s time with DCC was beginning, she positively impacted the Social Work team. Although Andrea’s time at Dialysis Care Center was cut short, she will be remembered as a champion for her patients. We want to honor her memory and share what made Andrea a hero to those around her. The DCC Family will miss her.
