We define it as the person who uses their time on Earth to impact peopleâ€™s lives positively. Remembered by those she worked with for her passion, Andrea dedicated her career to helping patients understand that dialysis is a part of their life, not their entire life. Andrea was an advocate for organ donation and worked tirelessly to make sure her patients understood the importance of being healthy and prepared for any opportunity. As a proud Delta Sigma Theta sorority member, Andrea was deeply involved in community service in the African American community. She brought her spirit and passion to everything she did at work and in her everyday life. Andrea joined the Dialysis Care Center family in September of 2021 as a Social Worker at the South Fulton and Hapeville, Georgia, locations. Throughout her time at DCC, Andrea always advocated to patients the importance of adjusting positively to life on dialysis and working hard to maintain their new lifestyles. She worked extensively with her co-worker Kim Birdsong to help educate patients on the importance of not missing dialysis treatments.
