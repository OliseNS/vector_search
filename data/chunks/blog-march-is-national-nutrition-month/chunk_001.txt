National Nutrition Month is an annual national campaign fostered by the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics that highlights the importance of making informed nutrition decisions and developing healthy food and physical activity habits. The month also is key in celebrating dietitians as the most valuable source of evidence-based food and nutrition information. In dialysis, dietitians are an essential part of the interdisciplinary team. They work closely with nephrologists (doctors specializing in kidney disease), nurses, social workers, and dialysis technicians to provide individualized care for each patient. Renal dietitians analyze protein and calorie intake, assess lab values, determine necessary vitamins and oral nutrition supplements, adjust bone medications, assess weight fluctuations, manage additional health conditions, and more! Each month, the dietitian sits down with each patient to create a nutrition plan, addressing any areas for improvement and highlighting the areas in which the patient is doing great. Dialysis patients need to have a great relationship with their dietitians, and having open lines of communication is crucial to receiving the best patient care.
