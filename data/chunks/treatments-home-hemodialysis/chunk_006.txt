Self-cannulation Self-cannulation refers to the patient taking the initiative to insert their own dialysis needles. In the case of home hemodialysis (HHD), patients undergo training to learn how to perform self-cannulation, or they can have their care partners assist them with the needle insertion process. Although the idea of self-cannulation may initially appear intimidating, the introduction of techniques like the buttonhole technique has greatly simplified and enhanced the comfort of self-cannulation.Some patients use the buttonhole for dialysis which involves inserting needles into the same spot repeatedly, resulting in scar tissue formation and the creation of a hole similar to a pierced ear.With this method, patients can use blunt needles instead of sharp needles, which are more comfortable and safer for the patient. Transitioning from in-center dialysis to HHD Many people who start with in-center hemodialysis eventually switch to home dialysis therapy. With home dialysis, you gain more freedom and flexibility while having a dedicated and highly trained clinical team just a phone call away. They aim to deliver excellent care and make your experience as comfortable as possible.
