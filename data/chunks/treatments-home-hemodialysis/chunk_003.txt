The role of a care partner varies depending on the patientâ€™s specific needs. Care partners undergo the same training as patients to ensure they can provide appropriate assistance. Self-cannulation Self-cannulation refers to the patient taking the initiative to insert their own dialysis needles. In the case of home hemodialysis (HHD), patients undergo training to learn how to perform self-cannulation, or they can have their care partners assist them with the needle insertion process. Although the idea of self-cannulation may initially appear intimidating, introducing techniques like the buttonhole technique has dramatically simplified and enhanced the comfort of self-cannulation. Some patients use the buttonhole for dialysis, which involves inserting needles into the same spot repeatedly, resulting in scar tissue formation and the creation of a hole similar to a pierced ear. With this method, patients can use blunt needles instead of sharp needles, which are more comfortable and safer. Training on HHD After you and your doctor have concluded that home hemodialysis (HHD) suits your needs and you have found a nearby Dialysis program, an HHD nurse will guide you through a customized training program that addresses your specific medical and learning requirements.
