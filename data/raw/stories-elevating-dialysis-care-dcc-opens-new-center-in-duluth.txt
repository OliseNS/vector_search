We’ve already built strong relationships in this area, and our Norcross clinic has been a great success. Duluth allows us to bring care closer to more patients who need it.”With the growing demand for dialysis services in the region, the new Duluth clinic makes it easier for patients to receive essential care without the burden of long travel. This means less stress and more time for patients to focus on their health and other daily activities.The clinic’s partnership with a local physician strengthens its ability to provide high-quality, personalized care. By being part of the community, we can ensure that patients feel comfortable, supported, and valued every step of the way.

From the moment it opens, patients can expect a welcoming environment and the medical care they need.Our Duluth patients will be treated by a dedicated team led by Medical Director Dr. Azeem Mohammed, Clinic Manager Tammie H., and five highly skilled staff members – who will ensure that every patient receives personalized and attentive care. Our team understands how important dialysis is to our patient’s health and is committed to making each visit as comfortable as possible.Dr. Salako emphasized that our goal is to “have the clinic up and running to provide patients with quality care. Duluth will be a premier independent dialysis center in the greater Atlanta area.” Patients can trust that they are in good hands with a facility dedicated to providing the highest level of care.Whether you’re new to dialysis or looking for a trusted center, Dialysis Care Center Duluth is here to support you every step of the way.
