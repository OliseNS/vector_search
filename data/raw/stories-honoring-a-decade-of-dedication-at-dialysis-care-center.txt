Many of our team members have been with us for over a decade, growing alongside the company, shaping its culture, and making a lasting impact on the lives of our patients. Here, we celebrate their stories, their dedication, and the moments that have defined their journey with DCC. Lori M. Senior Director, Revenue Cycle Management Lori’s journey began in Dr. Alausa’s Joliet office in 2013. When DCC was founded, she eagerly stepped in, excited to see it grow. From Billing Specialist to Senior Director of Revenue Cycle Management and Contracting, she takes immense pride in building and retaining a strong team. She finds the most joy in watching her staff solve complex issues and thrive in their roles. To newcomers, she offers this wisdom: “Dialysis is a tough disease, but no matter your role, you’re making a difference. Keep learning, keep growing.” Olanrewaju D. Senior Manager, Real Estate Development and Facilities Olanrewaju was drawn to DCC’s reputation for high-quality care and continuous learning. As Construction and Facilities Manager, he has overseen the growth of countless clinics and a rapidly expanding team. He thrives in DCC’s diverse and talented work environment, where no challenge is too big. His advice to new team members is to understand the company’s culture and mission, which are what attracted him to DCC! Mirza B. Senior Director IT When Mirza joined DCC, he saw a company with incredible potential. From one office in Joliet to multiple facilities across the states, he has been instrumental in building DCC’s IT infrastructure. Starting as a Systems Administrator, he worked his way up to Senior Director of IT. Knowing that his work supports the entire organization’s ability to deliver patient care keeps him motivated. What makes DCC special? “The leadership listens. New ideas are welcomed, and innovation is encouraged.” Jania B.

Her advice to newcomers: If you’re passionate about dialysis and patient care, DCC is the right place for you. Cristina G. Senior Manager, Revenue Cycle Management Fresh out of medical billing school, Cristina joined KCC with no experience, grateful for the opportunity to learn. She started as a Biller and transitioned into DCC’s early days, working in a small but mighty three-woman team. Over the years, she earned her current title, proving that hard work never goes unnoticed. She values her department and the flexibility to work from a clinic closer to home. Her advice? “Give it your all – your efforts will be recognized.” Amanda M. Director, Home HHD/TCU/ETD Amanda took a chance on peritoneal dialysis and quickly realized it was her calling.

Her advice to others: Stay committed to patient care – DCC recognizes and values hard work. Stephani S. Senior Patient Insurance Coordinator Stephani joined a young company focused on patient care and diversity. She stayed because of the incredible team she found at DCC. Starting as the sole Patient Insurance Coordinator, she helped build the Admissions department from the ground up. Stephani finds that the most rewarding part of her job is helping patients navigate insurance, which holds personal significance – her brother was a dialysis and transplant patient. Jami B. Quality Specialist, Patient Care Technician Jami started in the home program, helping patients receive dialysis at home. She transitioned from PCT to the Education Department and later into Compliance and Regulatory, proving that growth is always possible. She takes pride in doing worthwhile work and loves DCC’s diversity and teamwork. Her advice: Ask questions, build relationships, and always stay teachable. Mayra G.

As a Medical Assistant, she forms deep connections with patients, often meeting them in their most vulnerable moments. Seeing the relief on a patient’s face makes every effort worth it. Her advice to new employees: “Don’t be afraid to make a difference – your work has the power to change lives.” These individuals represent the heart of Dialysis Care Center.
