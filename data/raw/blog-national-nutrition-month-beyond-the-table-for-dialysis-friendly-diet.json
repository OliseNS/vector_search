This year’s theme, “Beyond the Table,” addresses the farm-to-fork aspect of nutrition, from food production and distribution to navigating grocery stores and farmers markets — and even home food safety and storage practices. It also describes the various ways we eat — not only around a dinner table but also on the go, in schools and restaurants, at games and events. This theme also includes sustainability, for instance, decreasing food waste from school and work to home and beyond. Here is how you can ensure that your dialysis-friendly diet incorporates sustainable practices and reduces food waste. Farm-to-Fork Journey of Nutrition: Explore local farmers’ markets: These markets often offer fresh, locally sourced produce. Supporting local farmers also promotes sustainable food practices. Start a small garden: Even if it’s just a few pots on a windowsill, growing your herbs or vegetables can help you understand and appreciate the effort put into food production. Choose seasonal produce: It’s often fresher and more nutritious and supports local agriculture. Various Ways We Eat: Practice mindful eating: Whether at home, school, or work, focus on the flavors and textures of your food. Pack nutritious snacks: If you’re on the go, plan ahead with healthy snacks like kidney-friendly fruits, or crackers. Choose healthier restaurant options: Look for dishes with lean proteins, kidney-friendly vegetables, and grains. Ask for dressings and sauces on the side. Sustainability and Food Waste Reduction: Plan meals and shopping lists: This can help you buy only what you need and reduce the likelihood of food going to waste. Store food properly: Learn the best storage practices for different types of produce and leftovers to extend their shelf life. Use leftovers creatively: Turn last night’s dinner into today’s lunch or repurpose ingredients in a new dish. Compost food scraps: Composting can help reduce waste and enrich the soil for future production. An essential part of maintaining a special diet is finding the proper support. Registered Dietitian Nutritionists (RDNs) are crucial in supporting individuals with kidney disease. A dietitian can help you create sustainable healthy habits that suit your unique needs! Customized Nutrition Guidance: RDNs work alongside your healthcare team to ensure your dietary plan complements your treatment strategy. Lab Results Analysis: They analyze your lab results to fine-tune dietary recommendations and bone medications. Cultural Considerations: Recommend therapeutic diets considering your cultural preferences and changes in treatment based on your nutritional needs in consultation with your physician. Counseling and Monitoring: RDNs can guide you and your family/caregiver and monitor your adherence and response to dietary interventions. Resource Referral: If needed, the RDNs can connect you with resources like financial aid and community support. Information Support: Registered dietitian nutritionists are available to address nutritional status, bone health, and fluid management queries. This year’s theme reminds us of the broader impact of our food choices, especially for those on dialysis. Let’s embrace sustainable practices that align with our dietary needs, making mindful choices that nourish both the body and the planet. Together, let’s march beyond the table, ensuring a healthier, more fulfilling life for all.
