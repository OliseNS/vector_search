Choosing the dialysis option Frequently asked questions What is Dialysis? Dialysis is generally started when your kidney function drops to 15% or less or if you have severe symptoms caused by your kidney disease. Shortness of breath, fatigue, muscle cramps, nausea, or vomiting are severe symptoms that may occur. When your kidneys cannot remove extra fluid and waste from the body, then dialysis is generally recommended.Your nephrologist will assist you in determining the appropriate time to begin dialysis, considering factors such as your remaining kidney function as determined by tests and your symptoms. It is advised to start preparing for dialysis well ahead of time, typically when your kidney disease progresses to stage 4, where the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) falls below 30 mL/min. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) often progresses slowly. Often, individuals are unaware of the extent of their discomfort until they commence dialysis, which can lead to a significant improvement in how they feel. To improve your well-being, it is crucial to adhere to the treatment plan recommended by your healthcare team, including doctors, nurses, dietitians, and social workers. Following their guidance can help you maintain the healthiest lifestyle possible. Choosing the dialysis option Selecting a dialysis option that suits your current way of life can enable you to continue enjoying the activities you love while keeping your health in check. Home peritoneal dialysis, home hemodialysis, or in-center dialysis are viable choices for most individuals. Making an early decision allows for more preparation time and can contribute to a greater sense of control over your health. In-center hemodialysis With in-center hemodialysis (HD), you’ll typically go to the dialysis center thrice per week for about 3 to 5 hours per session to have your blood filtered, depending on your doctor’s schedule. Throughout your treatment, a needle will be used to connect you to an artificial kidney (dialyzer) through your access site. Your healthcare team will closely monitor and oversee the entire dialysis process, ensuring that you have all the necessary support and resources you require. Home hemodialysis With home hemodialysis (HD), you are connected via a needle in your access site to an artificial kidney (dialyzer) that filters your blood. Opting for home-based treatment gives you the flexibility to schedule your prescribed treatments according to your daily activities. Treating at home eliminates the need to travel to a treatment center, saving travel time and transportation expenses. Peritoneal dialysis Home peritoneal dialysis (PD) involves using the peritoneum and the lining of your abdomen to filter your blood. Unlike other forms of dialysis, PD does not require needles, and your blood remains inside your body throughout the process. One of the advantages of PD is its flexibility, allowing you to perform treatments in various settings such as your home, workplace, or even while traveling. Initiating PD at an early stage may contribute to preserving any remaining kidney function. Frequently asked questions Who pays for dialysis?
