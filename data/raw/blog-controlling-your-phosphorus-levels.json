Individuals on dialysis often need to restrict the amount of phosphorus they eat and drink. This is because the kidneys can no longer eliminate excess amounts of phosphorus consumed, and dialysis alone cannot remove all the phosphorus from your blood. High phosphorus levels can cause itching, weak and brittle bones, fractures, and hardening of the arteries. Dialysis patients’ average blood phosphorus level is between 3.5 and 5.5 mg/dl. To keep phosphorus levels within this range, most people will need to limit high-phosphorus items in their diet and take their phosphorus binders as prescribed. Types of Phosphorus in Food and Beverages There are two types of phosphorus found in food and beverages: Natural phosphorus (organic) Foods high in natural phosphorus include milk and dairy products, nuts, beans, lentils, and whole grains. Man-made phosphorus (inorganic). Many manufacturers add man-made phosphorus to food and drinks as preservatives. Man-made phosphorus is added to many processed items such as deli meats, bacon, sausage, dark sodas, cheese, and baked goods. Check food labels for phosphorus additives, including any ingredient with the word “phos” in it!
