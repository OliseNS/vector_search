This yearly event, known as the Walk for Kidneys, is organized by the National Kidney Foundation of Illinois (NKFI) to raise awareness and funds for kidney disease research, education, and patient support. For Dialysis Care Center and Kidney Care Center, it’s more than just a walk – it’s a tradition built on love, remembrance, and the drive to make a difference.Why We WalkTeam Care has participated in the Kidney Walk since 2018. We have raised over $25,000 and gathered hundreds of participants over the years. However, the real impact cannot be measured in dollars or numbers; it is seen in the faces of those walking and felt in the stories they share.For Emmanuel I., an IT Associate, it’s about unity and purpose. “I love seeing colleagues from different departments come together to stand for a common cause.”The same feeling is shared by Mirza B., Senior Director of IT. “I participate in the Kidney Walk each year to support our patients and stand alongside the incredible team at the Dialysis Care Center and Kidney Care Center. Seeing our employees, families, and community come together with a shared purpose is a powerful reminder of why we do what we do.”That shared purpose is what makes the Kidney Walk more than just a fundraiser or an awareness event. It’s a message of action and a lifeline of support for people with kidney disease.Walking in MemoryFor Ganiat B., Senior Accountant at DCC Corporate, every step is a tribute.“I participate in the Kidney Walk to honor my dad. He was on dialysis for 13 years before he passed away. I walk every year to keep his memory alive.”She’s one of many on Team Care who walk in memory of a loved one. Janet P. remembers her father with every walk. Annette G. walks in honor of her uncle. Kim R. walks for her dad, who was also a dialysis patient.Victoria V., Dialysis Outreach Liaison, does it for her family. She explains, “I’m motivated to walk each year because kidney failure has affected my family and two close friends. I walk for my mother!”These moments of remembrance bring comfort and quiet strength. They remind everyone that even though a person may be gone, the love and lessons they left behind continue with every step forward.Turning Purpose into ActionSome walk to remember. Others walk to educate, advocate, and uplift.Rosalind P., a Patient Care Technician and long-time supporter, views Kidney Walk as an opportunity to speak out. “I do the Kidney Walk to help educate and raise awareness so patients can talk to their doctors about treatment choices.”And for Salman Azam, General Counsel, the event is a mix of mission and togetherness.“My family and I participate in the Kidney Walk every year with DCC’s Team Care. It’s a family event that brings colleagues and loved ones together on a beautiful June day, where we raise awareness and money to build hope for everyone affected.”For many, this walk serves as a way to loudly express what matters: patients’ rights, awareness, and the importance of early action. The energy is joyful but grounded in real stories and real struggles.The Heart Behind the WalkEvery year, Ning R., Director of Marketing and Outreach, leads Team Care’s Kidney Walk. Her dedication is a significant part of what makes the walk possible.“What excites and motivates me to coordinate the Kidney Walk each year is the direct impact it has on people’s lives,” she said. “I’m inspired by the resilience of kidney patients and their families.”For Ning, this goes beyond logistics. It’s about supporting people on their journey.“The walk is a way to raise awareness, build community, and support patient services. It reminds people that they’re not alone. It’s more than just an event. It’s a movement.”Her dedication ensures that each year, Team Care not only participates but does so with strength, knowledge, and a commitment to taking action. We are deeply grateful to Ning and every volunteer whose passion and hard work bring this walk to life year after year.More Than a WalkThis year alone, Team Care raised more than $6,700. While the amount is significant, its meaning matters more. Each dollar supports someone’s journey. Each step tells a story. Each walker sends a message: You are not alone.“We are proud to be recurring sponsors of the annual Chicago Walk for Kidneys, a cause close to our hearts,” said Dr. Babajide Salako, our Chief Executive Officer. “As Chicago-based companies, KCC and DCC are committed to caring for patients with kidney disease and partnering with the National Kidney Fund to raise awareness. Our sponsorship reflects our values and dedication to positively impacting our community.”The Kidney Walk embodies what Team Care represents: compassion, commitment, and community. Their participation shows that care extends beyond the clinic, continuing through every step, every memory, and every act of hope.
