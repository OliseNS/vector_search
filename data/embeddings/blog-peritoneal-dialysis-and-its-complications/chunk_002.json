  "content": "Some patients choose the flexible method of Dialysis called peritoneal Dialysis (PD), which uses the peritoneum membrane as a filter. The advantage of peritoneal Dialysis is the flexibility it offers. It can be performed independently at home, significantly improving quality of life. In addition, this vascular-sparing form of removing excess water and dissolved urinary substances can better preserve any remaining kidney function. The solution used during PD is a mixture of salt, minerals, and dextrose (sugar) dissolved in water, called dialysis solution, and is placed in a person’s abdominal cavity through a catheter. Peritoneal Dialysis-related infections, including peritonitis, exit‐site infections (ESI), and tunnel infections, are some of the complications resulting in significant morbidity and risk of death. Early complications related to peritoneal access are divided into mechanical (bleeding, visceral perforation, dialysate leaks, catheter dysfunction, hernia formation, cuff extrusion) and infectious (early peritonitis, surgical wound, tunnel, and exit site infections). Common Complications of Peritoneal Dialysis The most significant and commonly reported complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheters is an infection called Peritonitis. It is an infection of the abdominal cavity’s lining (peritoneum).",
