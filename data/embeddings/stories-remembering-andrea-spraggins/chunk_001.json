Andrea was a DCC Social Worker in our Georgia region starting in September 2021. In our eyes, Andrea Spraggins was a hero. What makes someone a hero? We define it as the person who uses their time on Earth to impact peopleâ€™s lives positively. Remembered by those she worked with for her passion, Andrea dedicated her career to helping patients understand that dialysis is a part of their life, not their entire life.",
