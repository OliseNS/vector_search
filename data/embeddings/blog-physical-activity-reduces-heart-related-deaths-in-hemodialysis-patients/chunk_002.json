  "content": "Heart-related deaths included sudden death, heart attack, atherosclerotic heart disease, cardiac arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, valvular heart disease, pulmonary edema, and congestive heart failure. Occasional physical activity was associated with a 20% lower risk for overall deaths and an 18% lower risk for heart-related deaths. Frequent physical activity was associated with an 18% lower risk for overall fatalities and a 23% lower risk for heart-related deaths. As physical activity increased, the risk of heart-related deaths significantly decreased. Investigators adjusted results for patients’ diets. These results show that even low levels of physical activities without risk of injuries can yield a positive effect on lowering the risk for death in these patients – Dr. Bernier-Jean’s team concluded during the study. This study also encourages future randomized controlled trials of low-intensity physical activity for sedentary adults receiving hemodialysis.",
