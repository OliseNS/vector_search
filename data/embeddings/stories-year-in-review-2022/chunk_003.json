  "content": "Every quarter, we are proud to announce and recognize the winners of the DCC Ambassador Awards. These Ambassadors are the best among us, and they provide excellent service and Lead with Care every day. In July, DCC kicked off Employee Appreciation Week, which featured 5 consecutive days of appreciation for the entire DCC Family. Events included Brunch, Pizza Lunch, Appreciation Day, Ice Cream Day, and a Raffle to end the week. Although appreciation week is one week long, we appreciate the dedication of our staff every day. “When I joined Dialysis Care Center in 2014, my goal was to grow this company to a place where we would positively impact our patients’ lives. Our hardworking and dedicated team makes DCC an incredible place for patients and employees. Our team is our biggest strength, and I thank the team for everything they do and for Leading with Care.” As DCC solidifies our strategic plan for 2023, our strong team of professionals will continue to contribute positively to the lives of our patients and the communities we serve.",
