  "content": "In 2022, DCC committed to continuing to connect with the people in the communities we serve. DCC has hosted and participated in many community events to bring awareness to renal diseases. In June, we proudly sponsored the Walk for Kidneys, Hosted by the National Kidney Foundation of Illinois. Our Team Care came out in numbers to support our patients and help raise awareness and money. Dialysis Care Center and Kidney Care Center hosted a fundraiser for NKFI at our Annual End of the Year Celebration, raising money to help those with renal diseases. During Halloween, DCC participated in a local Trunk or Treat event to raise kidney health awareness and hand out candy to the local children. In November, the DCC Family collected items to be donated to local food banks for the holidays. All the work, growth, and achievements are only possible with our dedicated team members. As a thank you to our team, we have hosted many employee recognition events throughout the year. Every quarter, we are proud to announce and recognize the winners of the DCC Ambassador Awards. These Ambassadors are the best among us, and they provide excellent service and Lead with Care every day.",
