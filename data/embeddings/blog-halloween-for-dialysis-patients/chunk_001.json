Tips for Surviving Halloween Avoid buying candies that arenâ€™t dialysis-friendly; that way, you are not tempted. If you have diabetes, choose sugar-free or low-sugar candies. Avoid high phosphorus and high potassium ingredients in candy-like chocolate and nuts. Take a 10 to 15-minute walk or do a physical activity for each piece of candy you eat. Share!
