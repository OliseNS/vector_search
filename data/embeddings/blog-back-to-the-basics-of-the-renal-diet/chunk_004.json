  "content": "Slash Your Sodium Intake: Sodium is a mineral found in many foods and is often added in large amounts to processed foods. Limit your sodium intake to less than 2000 mg/day. Symptoms that you might be consuming too much sodium in your diet include high blood pressure, swelling/edema, shortness of breath, and difficulty controlling your fluid weight gain daily. Wise Up with Water: One of the most important functions of the kidneys is eliminating excess fluid to maintain proper fluid balance in the body. When the kidney is not working, this function is impaired, and while many people still urinate when they start dialysis, most often, the kidney is not able to get rid of the excess fluid. Too much fluid build-up in your body can lead to high blood pressure, difficulty breathing normally, and swelling/edema, which can cause damage to your heart, leading to heart failure. The recommended total fluid intake in 24 hours for most people on dialysis is 1,000 mL (4 8oz cups) per day, plus the amount of urine output. Your dietitian will recommend how much to limit your fluid intake each day.",
