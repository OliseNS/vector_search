  "content": "However, when your kidneys aren’t working properly, the potassium from your diet isn’t removed and can build up too high in the blood. Your dialysis treatments and the proper diet will help keep your potassium level regular. The normal potassium range is 3.5-5. Phosphorus: Phosphorus is a mineral found naturally in many foods, including meats, poultry, fish, beans, dairy, and nuts. However, phosphorus is mainly found in processed foods, and food manufacturers often add phosphorus to foods and beverages as a preservative. Too much phosphorus will often build up in the blood when the kidneys are not working correctly. This will cause calcium to leak out of your bones, thus making them weaker, and deposit itself in the blood vessels and other organs, leading to hardening of the arteries and causing organs to malfunction over time. Many patients also need to take a “phosphorus binder” medication with their meals and snacks to help keep phosphorus levels normal between 3.5 and 5.5. Slash Your Sodium Intake: Sodium is a mineral found in many foods and is often added in large amounts to processed foods. Limit your sodium intake to less than 2000 mg/day.",
