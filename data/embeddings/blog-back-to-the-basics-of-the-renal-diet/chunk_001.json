Diet becomes an essential part of maintaining your health and well-being. Each personâ€™s dialysis diet prescription is different, but the primary nutrients limited in the renal diet are protein, potassium, phosphorus, sodium, and fluid. Your renal dietitian will review your labs, assist you with controlling these nutrients in your diet, and provide additional dietary education and assistance based on your individual needs. Power Up with Protein: Choose fresh meats, fish, and eggs, and try to get at least 2-4 oz at each meal.",
