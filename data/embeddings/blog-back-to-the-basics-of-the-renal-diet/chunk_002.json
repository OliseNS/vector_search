  "content": "Your renal dietitian will review your labs, assist you with controlling these nutrients in your diet, and provide additional dietary education and assistance based on your individual needs. Power Up with Protein: Choose fresh meats, fish, and eggs, and try to get at least 2-4 oz at each meal. Avoid enhanced and pre-cooked meats as they may contain high amounts of sodium, phosphate, and potassium additives. Albumin is the measure of protein in your blood that will be checked every month at dialysis. The goal is to achieve an albumin level of 4 or greater. You may also benefit from a protein supplement. Ask your dietitian to see which protein supplement is appropriate for you. Potassium: Potassium is a common mineral found in fruits, vegetables, dairy, beans, nuts, and salt substitutes. Potassium is essential to help your muscles and nerves work correctly. However, when your kidneys aren’t working properly, the potassium from your diet isn’t removed and can build up too high in the blood. Your dialysis treatments and the proper diet will help keep your potassium level regular. The normal potassium range is 3.5-5.",
