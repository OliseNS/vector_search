  "content": "An average phosphorus level is 3.5-5.5 mg/dL. You can keep your phosphorus level under control by understanding your diet and medications for phosphorus control. Choose low-phosphorus foods and proteins such as fresh poultry, lean beef, fish and seafood, and cottage cheese. Cook from scratch at home and limit intake of highly processed foods and eating out. Read food labels and avoid foods with “P-H-O-S” in the ingredients list, i.e., Monosodium phosphate, Phosphoric acid, and Dicalcium phosphate. If prescribed phosphorus binders, remember to take them with each meal. Be Mindful of Your Potassium Intake Your potassium levels should remain between 3.5 – 5.0mg/dL. A dialysis patient should not consume more than 2000mg of potassium daily. Too high or low potassium is dangerous as it affects your heart rate. Here are some ways to keep it in a normal range: Check with your dietitian or physician for the safe amount that works for you. Read food labels. Potassium is now commonly found on the nutrition facts label. Look for foods with no more than 200 mg of potassium per serving. Choose foods lower in potassium, such as apples, grapes, plums, berries, bell peppers, onions, carrots, cucumbers, lettuce, corn, and green beans.",
