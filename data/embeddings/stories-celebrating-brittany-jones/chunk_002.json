In-Center Clinic Work Brittany works with DCC Lebanon and DCC Hershey simultaneously. She emphasizes that organization and consistent communication are critical to an efficient and productive team. Through educating staff and patients, the clinics can stay on top of treatments and the patientâ€™s health, which is a top priority.

This achievement is tangible evidence that diligent effort and unwavering dedication yield meaningful results.
