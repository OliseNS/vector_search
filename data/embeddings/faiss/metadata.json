    "content": "Holidays such as Thanksgiving, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, Christmas, and New Year’s Day traditionally revolve around food. Diet is very crucial for patients with kidney disease. Here are some suggestions to help you avoid diet pitfalls that the holidays bring. Always ask your renal dietitian about healthy meal choices for your individual eating plan when in doubt. Limit salty foods, which make you thirsty. If you overeat salt, you may drink too much fluid and possibly make your subsequent dialysis treatment difficult. Avoid brined turkey and ham due to the high sodium. Remember to take your phosphate binders! These should always be taken with food. Make your food from scratch using low-sodium condiments and fresh herbs & spices. Portion control! If eating turkey, beef, pork, or fish, make sure it’s the biggest portion on your plate. 3 oz protein food is equal to the size of your palm or a standard deck of cards. Leach potatoes to lower the potassium content. To leach: Peel the potatoes and cut them into small pieces. Soak in ample water (for 1 cup of potatoes, remember to use 10 cups of water) for at least four hours.",

What should I avoid? How do I communicate my needs without feeling like a burden?” If you’ve asked yourself any of these questions, you will find solutions below to avoid the holiday pitfalls. Don’t stress; we’re here to help you enjoy the food and loved ones you love. Although they may need a little education, you will often find that your loved ones support your needs and want to provide food that everyone, including you, can enjoy. If you are attending Thanksgiving dinner, it may be a good idea to cook one or two kidney-friendly dishes that you know you will be able to eat. Ask your host what they plan to serve beforehand so that you can help fill in the gaps with your favorite dishes. Show your loved ones that kidney-friendly foods can be healthy and delicious, so bring enough to share! Always remember the importance of portion control. Just because a dish isn’t kidney-friendly doesn’t mean you must avoid it altogether.",

Just because a dish isn’t kidney-friendly doesn’t mean you must avoid it altogether. Proper portion control can help you keep yourself in check, allow a little leeway, and prevent you from derailing your usual diet. Some commonly consumed Thanksgiving foods can be high in phosphorus and potassium – macaroni and cheese, gravy, yams, sweet potatoes, and mashed potatoes, to name a few. If you decide to indulge in any foods you know may not be the best for you, limit your portions to less than ½ cup and try to avoid seconds and thirds. Be mindful of canned and processed foods – boxed stuffing, cranberry sauce, gravy mixes, fried meats, powdered mashed potatoes, and premade desserts – as these foods can be high in phosphorus and phosphorus additives. You can make these items from scratch at home to decrease the phosphorus content. Make sure to bring and take your phosphorus binders with you for your meal.",

Watching what we consume does not only apply to the foods we choose but also to the drinks. Some great holiday favorites include lemon-lime soda, ginger ale, Fresca, club soda, cranberry, apple, and grapes juices. If you have diabetes, be sure to watch your sugar levels and opt for lower-sugar or sugar-free varieties.

Diet becomes an essential part of maintaining your health and well-being. Each person’s dialysis diet prescription is different, but the primary nutrients limited in the renal diet are protein, potassium, phosphorus, sodium, and fluid. Your renal dietitian will review your labs, assist you with controlling these nutrients in your diet, and provide additional dietary education and assistance based on your individual needs. Power Up with Protein: Choose fresh meats, fish, and eggs, and try to get at least 2-4 oz at each meal.",

Power Up with Protein: Choose fresh meats, fish, and eggs, and try to get at least 2-4 oz at each meal. Avoid enhanced and pre-cooked meats as they may contain high amounts of sodium, phosphate, and potassium additives. Albumin is the measure of protein in your blood that will be checked every month at dialysis. The goal is to achieve an albumin level of 4 or greater. You may also benefit from a protein supplement. Ask your dietitian to see which protein supplement is appropriate for you. Potassium: Potassium is a common mineral found in fruits, vegetables, dairy, beans, nuts, and salt substitutes. Potassium is essential to help your muscles and nerves work correctly. However, when your kidneys aren’t working properly, the potassium from your diet isn’t removed and can build up too high in the blood. Your dialysis treatments and the proper diet will help keep your potassium level regular. The normal potassium range is 3.5-5.",

Your dialysis treatments and the proper diet will help keep your potassium level regular. The normal potassium range is 3.5-5. Phosphorus: Phosphorus is a mineral found naturally in many foods, including meats, poultry, fish, beans, dairy, and nuts. However, phosphorus is mainly found in processed foods, and food manufacturers often add phosphorus to foods and beverages as a preservative. Too much phosphorus will often build up in the blood when the kidneys are not working correctly. This will cause calcium to leak out of your bones, thus making them weaker, and deposit itself in the blood vessels and other organs, leading to hardening of the arteries and causing organs to malfunction over time. Many patients also need to take a “phosphorus binder” medication with their meals and snacks to help keep phosphorus levels normal between 3.5 and 5.5. Slash Your Sodium Intake: Sodium is a mineral found in many foods and is often added in large amounts to processed foods. Limit your sodium intake to less than 2000 mg/day.",

Symptoms that you might be consuming too much sodium in your diet include high blood pressure, swelling/edema, shortness of breath, and difficulty controlling your fluid weight gain daily. Wise Up with Water: One of the most important functions of the kidneys is eliminating excess fluid to maintain proper fluid balance in the body. When the kidney is not working, this function is impaired, and while many people still urinate when they start dialysis, most often, the kidney is not able to get rid of the excess fluid. Too much fluid build-up in your body can lead to high blood pressure, difficulty breathing normally, and swelling/edema, which can cause damage to your heart, leading to heart failure. The recommended total fluid intake in 24 hours for most people on dialysis is 1,000 mL (4 8oz cups) per day, plus the amount of urine output. Your dietitian will recommend how much to limit your fluid intake each day.",

Individuals on dialysis often need to restrict the amount of phosphorus they eat and drink. This is because the kidneys can no longer eliminate excess amounts of phosphorus consumed, and dialysis alone cannot remove all the phosphorus from your blood. High phosphorus levels can cause itching, weak and brittle bones, fractures, and hardening of the arteries. Dialysis patients’ average blood phosphorus level is between 3.5 and 5.5 mg/dl. To keep phosphorus levels within this range, most people will need to limit high-phosphorus items in their diet and take their phosphorus binders as prescribed.",

Man-made phosphorus (inorganic). Many manufacturers add man-made phosphorus to food and drinks as preservatives. Man-made phosphorus is added to many processed items such as deli meats, bacon, sausage, dark sodas, cheese, and baked goods.

Expanded dialysis is a new treatment method that can remove a broader range of toxins from the body than conventional dialysis. This study was conducted for three months with 28 patients. The new dialyzer used in the study has precisely made pores that allow larger-sized toxic chemicals to be filtered from the blood as well while retaining essential molecules such as albumin.",

The new dialyzer used in the study has precisely made pores that allow larger-sized toxic chemicals to be filtered from the blood as well while retaining essential molecules such as albumin. The substances that can now be filtered out can cause inflammation, malnutrition, and chronic symptoms like fatigue if left in the body. Traditional dialysis treatments haven’t been as successful at removing these specific chemicals, and patients often report significant side effects. One of the study participants with chronic kidney disease had been on dialysis for about five years. He complained of reduced appetite, weakness, and reduced sleep quality previously. He reported feeling better, improved appetite, and improved sleep quality with expanded dialysis. With the first phase of this study completed and published in Kidney Medicine, the scientist will move on to the next stage. The next phase will be conducted with 60 dialysis patients for six months of treatments using the new dialyzer. The second phase will be a multicentered clinical study, simultaneously led by Lawson, University of Toronto, and Humber College.",

    "content": "Our expert DCC dietitians are excited to share some essential tips for our dialysis patients. Our goal is to help our patients enjoy the season’s beauty while keeping their health in check. So, let’s dive in! Pack the Protein Keeping your albumin in the normal range is essential to help you fight infections, maintain proper fluid balance, and maintain strength and muscle function. You should aim for 2-4 ounces of high-quality protein at each meal. Animal protein examples are beef, chicken, eggs, turkey, fish, seafood Plant proteins like tofu, tempeh, quinoa, seitan Processed meats like hot doga, bacon, sausage, and bologna are lower-quality options Oral nutrition supplements can be a great way to add extra protein to your diet. You can talk to your dietitian about kidney-friendly options of oral nutrition supplements. Be Mindful of Your Phosphorus Intake High phosphorus levels are associated with cellular damage in the human body. An average phosphorus level is 3.5-5.5 mg/dL. You can keep your phosphorus level under control by understanding your diet and medications for phosphorus control. Choose low-phosphorus foods and proteins such as fresh poultry, lean beef, fish and seafood, and cottage cheese.",

Choose low-phosphorus foods and proteins such as fresh poultry, lean beef, fish and seafood, and cottage cheese. Cook from scratch at home and limit intake of highly processed foods and eating out. Read food labels and avoid foods with “P-H-O-S” in the ingredients list, i.e., Monosodium phosphate, Phosphoric acid, and Dicalcium phosphate. If prescribed phosphorus binders, remember to take them with each meal. Be Mindful of Your Potassium Intake Your potassium levels should remain between 3.5 – 5.0mg/dL. A dialysis patient should not consume more than 2000mg of potassium daily. Too high or low potassium is dangerous as it affects your heart rate. Here are some ways to keep it in a normal range: Check with your dietitian or physician for the safe amount that works for you. Read food labels. Potassium is now commonly found on the nutrition facts label. Look for foods with no more than 200 mg of potassium per serving. Choose foods lower in potassium, such as apples, grapes, plums, berries, bell peppers, onions, carrots, cucumbers, lettuce, corn, and green beans.",

Limit intakes of Foods higher in potassium, such as potatoes & sweet potatoes, tomatoes, oranges, bananas, pumpkin, winter squash, and Brussels sprouts. Limit Your Sodium Most people with kidney disease should limit sodium intake to <2,300 mg/day. Some ways to decrease sodium intake are to: Buy fresh foods and cook from scratch more often because canned and prepackaged foods are often high in sodium Avoid high-sodium foods like pizza, chips, canned soups Rinse sodium-containing canned foods like beans and tuna Use spices, herbs, and sodium-free seasonings to flavor dishes Avoid salt substitutes as they can be high in potassium Always read the Nutrition Facts label in order to compare sodium content Choose light or reduced-sodium condiments Manage Your Fluids What is a fluid?

The US Food and Drug Administration has asked for an additional clinical trial to demonstrate the benefits of Tenapanor before it approves the drug. Tenapanor has shown good prospects in trials to control serum phosphorus in adult individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on dialysis. Tenapanor is an oral drug that inhibits the sodium-proton exchanger NHE3. The drug was submitted for approval to treat hyperphosphatemia in patients with CKD on dialysis. The data is supported by three phase-3 clinical trials involving more than 1000 patients.",

The data is supported by three phase-3 clinical trials involving more than 1000 patients. The FDA stated that approval of the drug application would require the drug manufacturer to carry out another “adequate and well-controlled trial” that shows this treatment can have a meaningful impact on the level of phosphorus in the blood or improve a health issue caused by hyperphosphatemia in dialysis patients with chronic kidney disease. CKD Patients receiving dialysis treatments are highly likely to be hyperphosphatemic. Current Therapies for Hyperphosphatemia are only moderately effective and challenging to implement. Current strategies for managing hyperphosphatemia can include more frequent hemodialysis therapies, dietary phosphate restriction, and phosphate binder therapy. Untreated hyperphosphatemia in patients can lead to dystrophic calcification, accelerated arteriosclerotic vascular disease, and fractures. In the previous study, 236 dialysis patients with hyperphosphatemia, despite treatment with a phosphate binder therapy, were given 4 weeks of treatment. The treatment included either the twice-daily oral Tenapanor or a placebo dose. The results showed that the drug treatment group significantly changed serum phosphorus concentration over placebo.",

Tips for Surviving Halloween Avoid buying candies that aren’t dialysis-friendly; that way, you are not tempted. If you have diabetes, choose sugar-free or low-sugar candies. Avoid high phosphorus and high potassium ingredients in candy-like chocolate and nuts. Take a 10 to 15-minute walk or do a physical activity for each piece of candy you eat. Share!

    "content": "Whatever holidays you celebrate, this is a time that many enjoy their favorite foods. But we still need to be mindful of our food choices. Here are some helpful reminders to enjoy your favorite cultural foods during this time of year! Be mindful of food and drink choices It can be very easy to let loose when celebrating the holidays. Since you are on dialysis, it is essential to remember your renal diet fundamentals. Talk to your doctor about alcohol. It should be consumed modestly based on your overall fluid intake and medications. If they advise against it, choose sugar-free lemon-lime soda, ginger ale, sparkling cider, or low-potassium juices like apple, grape, or cranberry juice. It is imperative to bring your phosphorus binder to all of your holiday get-togethers if you are having holiday dinner with others. Use small plates to help control your food portions, and avoid snacking throughout the day. Ensure you include plenty of lean proteins throughout the day to avoid overeating during the holiday celebrations. Choose healthier alternatives Avoid nuts, chocolate, or hot cocoa, as these foods are high in phosphorus. Pumpkin and sweet potato pie are high in potassium.",

Choose healthier alternatives Avoid nuts, chocolate, or hot cocoa, as these foods are high in phosphorus. Pumpkin and sweet potato pie are high in potassium. Instead, try a slice of fruit pie like apple or blueberry. Jell-O, fruit sherbet, or a small slice of fruit cake are also great dessert options! If you plan to serve a potato dish, try double-boiled mashed potatoes, as this cooking method will remove a lot of potassium. Try sticking to ½ cup portions for dishes that are higher in potassium or phosphorus. Watch out for salt! Going over your sodium restriction this time of year can be very easy. Avoid or limit gravies, chips, and prepackaged crackers. When seasoning meats, avoid basting and use spices like chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, paprika, and olive oil to help flavor your food without adding salt. Lemon and herbs like rosemary, tarragon, and oregano are complimentary seasonings. Avoid stress and make time for yourself Holidays can become very hectic with all the social gatherings happening simultaneously.",

While it is important to share love with others, it is equally important to remember to share that love with yourself and your heart! Heart health is essential for this month and the rest of the year. Incorporate Healthy Fats into Your Diet Foods rich in unsaturated fats reduce LDL “bad” cholesterol levels and improve overall heart health. There are only two types of unsaturated fats – monounsaturated and polyunsaturated. Examples of monounsaturated fats are canola oil, peanut oil, avocado oil, and olive oil. Use these oils for sautéing, lightly pan frying, as a dip for bread, dressing for a salad, or as the base of marinades for heart-healthy proteins like chicken, fish, and tofu. Monounsaturated fats can also be found in potassium-rich foods like avocados, nuts, and seeds. Refer to your dietitian for guidance on including these foods in your diet. Omega-3 fatty acids, shown to lower the risk of heart disease, are found in foods rich in polyunsaturated fats like salmon, tuna, flaxseeds, and fish oil supplements.",

Omega-3 fatty acids, shown to lower the risk of heart disease, are found in foods rich in polyunsaturated fats like salmon, tuna, flaxseeds, and fish oil supplements. When choosing to buy a fish oil supplement, make sure it includes DHA and EPA omega-3 fatty acids – these two compounds have been shown to decrease inflammation and even reduce your risk of heart disease. Please refer to your physician before starting a supplement. Decrease Your Intake of Saturated and Trans-Fats Diets that are high in saturated and trans-fats have been shown to increase LDL “bad” cholesterol and reduce HDL “good” cholesterol, which can increase your risk of heart disease and stroke. There is some debate around the nutritional value of saturated fats, but overall, research shows that limiting our intake of saturated fat is best. Foods high in saturated fat include butter, red meat, whole milk, cheese, ice cream, and tropical oils like coconut and palm. Trans-fats are a different story and should be consumed minimally. Foods high in trans fat include margarine, fried foods, vegetable shortening, highly processed foods, and baked goods.",

When grocery shopping, read food labels and avoid “partially hydrogenated oils.” Choose these foods less often and replace them with foods high in unsaturated fats. Include More Fiber in Your Diet We all know fiber is essential for our gut health and helps to keep our bowel movement regular, but did you know it can also be good for your heart? Including more fiber in your diet helps remove the bad cholesterol and can help lower the risk of heart disease! Kidney-friendly fiber foods include raspberries, blueberries, apples, peaches, asparagus, corn, cabbage, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, carrots, and tangerines. Remember that high-fiber foods can be high in potassium and phosphorus. Ask your renal dietitian about high-fiber foods you can include in your renal diet.",

Remember that high-fiber foods can be high in potassium and phosphorus. Ask your renal dietitian about high-fiber foods you can include in your renal diet. Control Fluid and Salt Intake As always, limiting salt and fluid intake is extremely important, as consuming too much can cause your body to hold onto extra fluid, leading to shortness of breath. When you are short of breath for a prolonged period, it makes your heart work harder than it should. Fluid limits are individualized and determined by swelling, weight gain between treatments, and if you can still urinate. When grocery shopping, read food labels and avoid consuming over 2,000 mg of sodium daily. Reduce Stressors and Take Time to Love Yourself Yes, stress can decrease your overall heart health! It’s important to note that experiencing continuous feelings of anger, sadness, or anxiety can have negative impacts on your overall health, both physically and mentally. Additionally, it can lead to undue stress on your heart. Talk to your social worker about ways to cope with stress and resources that can help reduce your life’s stressors.",

Because dialysis is a big-time commitment, it may be tempting to skip treatments or cut treatments short occasionally. Maybe it’s a cold and rainy day, or you’re feeling under the weather, or you are leaving town for a last-minute vacation. You may think, what’s the big deal if I miss one, two, or even three treatments? Skipping dialysis treatments or cutting your treatments short can be very dangerous for your health.",

    "content": "You may think, what’s the big deal if I miss one, two, or even three treatments? Skipping dialysis treatments or cutting your treatments short can be very dangerous for your health. The amount of time and how often you need dialysis is determined by your nephrologist to meet your individual needs. Getting adequate dialysis ensures that toxins and excess fluids are being removed from your body so that you can stay healthy. When you skip treatments or terminate treatments early, additional fluid will need to be removed at your next dialysis treatment, which can cause uncomfortable symptoms such as cramping, headaches, low blood pressure, or nausea as we try to get you back to your dry weight. You may also feel shortness of breath, which can lead to hospitalization due to fluid overload. Aside from fluid removal, the kidneys are also responsible for managing your blood pressure and keeping a safe balance of key minerals, such as potassium and phosphorus. High potassium can lead to heart problems, including irregular heartbeat, heart attack, and death. High phosphorus can weaken your bones and increase your risk for heart disease. It’s not worth the risk!",

Plus, you’ll get a firsthand look into a real patient’s story to see what this path can truly look like. Whether you’re preparing for a transplant, supporting a loved one, or simply looking for answers, you’ve come to the right place. When Is a Kidney Transplant Needed? Your kidneys are small but mighty—they filter waste, balance fluids, and help regulate blood pressure. But when they stop working properly (often due to diabetes, high blood pressure, or chronic kidney disease), you’re faced with end-stage kidney failure. At this stage, you’ll typically have two treatment options: dialysis or a kidney transplant. Kidney transplant is a surgical procedure where a healthy donor kidney is placed into someone whose kidneys no longer work properly. Kidney transplants are not a cure, but they offer the chance for a longer, better quality of life without the burden of daily or weekly dialysis. What Happens While You Wait?",

Here’s the truth: the wait for a kidney transplant can be long; months, sometimes even years. The waiting time depends on factors like blood type, body size, overall health, medical urgency, and availability of matching donors. In the meantime, you’ll keep going to dialysis and work closely with your healthcare team. You’ll have regular checkups, lab work, and evaluations to make sure you are eligible for surgery. Eating a kidney-friendly diet, regular exercise, quitting smoking (if you smoke), and taking your medicine on time can help you take charge of your health while you wait. Every healthy choice you make now can improve your chances of a successful transplant. Preparing for the Surgery Once a match is found, everything moves quickly. Whether it’s a living or deceased donor, your transplant team will jump into action to make sure you’re ready. Before surgery, you will: Undergo final tests to confirm the match and ensure you’re healthy enough for the operation.",

Your care team will review risks and benefits, so you fully understand the procedure. You’ll stop eating and drinking several hours before the surgery, as directed. Medications may be adjusted or paused, including dialysis schedules and blood pressure meds. You may feel a mix of emotions like excitement, anxiety, and hope. All of that is normal. This is a major step, and your transplant team will support you every step of the way. What to Expect During the Surgery A kidney transplant typically takes about 3–5 hours and is performed under general anesthesia. Here’s a simple breakdown of what to expect: The surgeon makes a surgical cut in your lower abdomen. The donor kidney is connected to your blood vessels and bladder. In most cases, your old kidneys are left in place unless they’re causing issues.",

In most cases, your old kidneys are left in place unless they’re causing issues. Once everything is connected, the new kidney usually starts working right away, but in some cases, it may take a few days. After surgery, you’ll be taken to a recovery room, where your vitals, fluid levels, and kidney function will be closely monitored. Recovering After Transplant Recovery from kidney transplant surgery typically involves a hospital stay of 5 to 10 days. During this time, your medical team will: Monitor your new kidney’s function Manage your pain Watch for signs of infection or organ rejection Begin your post-transplant medication plan From now on, immunosuppressants will become a permanent part of your daily routine. These medications help prevent your body from rejecting the new kidney but also lower your immune system’s ability to fight infections. That’s why staying extra cautious with hygiene is key.",

You’ll need to: Go to frequent checkups and blood tests Follow a special diet to protect your new kidney Avoid heavy lifting and strenuous activity Stay away from sick people and crowded places You may feel tired at first, and that’s okay. Healing takes time. Most people gradually regain their energy and begin to enjoy activities that were once too difficult. Long-Term Recovery After Transplant With good care, a transplanted kidney from a living donor can last 15 to 20 years or more, while one from a deceased donor usually lasts 10 to 15 years. Many transplant recipients go back to work, travel, eat their favorite foods, and get back to living life to the fullest. But your job’s not done.",

Taking steps to lower potassium content is essential to still enjoy your favorite foods, especially while on dialysis. Leaching potatoes and other root vegetables can reduce the potassium content by 50-75%. Although leaching lowers potassium content, you must limit the amount of leached high-potassium vegetables in your diet. Leaching Directions Wash and peel the vegetables. Cut the vegetable into 1/8-inch pieces. Place the vegetable pieces in a pot and fill it with room-temperature water. Use double the amount of water compared to the vegetable.

The month also is key in celebrating dietitians as the most valuable source of evidence-based food and nutrition information. In dialysis, dietitians are an essential part of the interdisciplinary team. They work closely with nephrologists (doctors specializing in kidney disease), nurses, social workers, and dialysis technicians to provide individualized care for each patient. Renal dietitians analyze protein and calorie intake, assess lab values, determine necessary vitamins and oral nutrition supplements, adjust bone medications, assess weight fluctuations, manage additional health conditions, and more! Each month, the dietitian sits down with each patient to create a nutrition plan, addressing any areas for improvement and highlighting the areas in which the patient is doing great. Dialysis patients need to have a great relationship with their dietitians, and having open lines of communication is crucial to receiving the best patient care.",

We understand the challenges of finding time to exercise while meeting the job demands. However, small steps like taking stairs instead of the elevator or stretching exercises during shift breaks can make a difference. Find enjoyable and sustainable activities that work for you.

By prioritizing your sleep, you can provide your patients with the highest level of care. Engage in mindful meditation: As a nurse, caring for yourself while caring for others is essential. One effective way to do this is by setting aside a few minutes each day to connect with yourself through meditation.

This year’s theme, “Beyond the Table,” addresses the farm-to-fork aspect of nutrition, from food production and distribution to navigating grocery stores and farmers markets — and even home food safety and storage practices. It also describes the various ways we eat — not only around a dinner table but also on the go, in schools and restaurants, at games and events. This theme also includes sustainability, for instance, decreasing food waste from school and work to home and beyond.",

This theme also includes sustainability, for instance, decreasing food waste from school and work to home and beyond. Here is how you can ensure that your dialysis-friendly diet incorporates sustainable practices and reduces food waste. Farm-to-Fork Journey of Nutrition: Explore local farmers’ markets: These markets often offer fresh, locally sourced produce. Supporting local farmers also promotes sustainable food practices. Start a small garden: Even if it’s just a few pots on a windowsill, growing your herbs or vegetables can help you understand and appreciate the effort put into food production. Choose seasonal produce: It’s often fresher and more nutritious and supports local agriculture. Various Ways We Eat: Practice mindful eating: Whether at home, school, or work, focus on the flavors and textures of your food. Pack nutritious snacks: If you’re on the go, plan ahead with healthy snacks like kidney-friendly fruits, or crackers. Choose healthier restaurant options: Look for dishes with lean proteins, kidney-friendly vegetables, and grains. Ask for dressings and sauces on the side.",

Sustainability and Food Waste Reduction: Plan meals and shopping lists: This can help you buy only what you need and reduce the likelihood of food going to waste. Store food properly: Learn the best storage practices for different types of produce and leftovers to extend their shelf life. Use leftovers creatively: Turn last night’s dinner into today’s lunch or repurpose ingredients in a new dish. Compost food scraps: Composting can help reduce waste and enrich the soil for future production. An essential part of maintaining a special diet is finding the proper support. Registered Dietitian Nutritionists (RDNs) are crucial in supporting individuals with kidney disease. A dietitian can help you create sustainable healthy habits that suit your unique needs!

Due to this trend, the number of people who need renal replacement therapy is also on the rise. One of the major tasks of the kidneys is filtering the metabolites from the blood. If the kidneys can no longer perform this job, the blood must be cleansed and drained artificially through Dialysis (blood washing). Some patients choose the flexible method of Dialysis called peritoneal Dialysis (PD), which uses the peritoneum membrane as a filter. The advantage of peritoneal Dialysis is the flexibility it offers.",

The advantage of peritoneal Dialysis is the flexibility it offers. It can be performed independently at home, significantly improving quality of life. In addition, this vascular-sparing form of removing excess water and dissolved urinary substances can better preserve any remaining kidney function. The solution used during PD is a mixture of salt, minerals, and dextrose (sugar) dissolved in water, called dialysis solution, and is placed in a person’s abdominal cavity through a catheter. Peritoneal Dialysis-related infections, including peritonitis, exit‐site infections (ESI), and tunnel infections, are some of the complications resulting in significant morbidity and risk of death. Early complications related to peritoneal access are divided into mechanical (bleeding, visceral perforation, dialysate leaks, catheter dysfunction, hernia formation, cuff extrusion) and infectious (early peritonitis, surgical wound, tunnel, and exit site infections). Common Complications of Peritoneal Dialysis The most significant and commonly reported complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheters is an infection called Peritonitis. It is an infection of the abdominal cavity’s lining (peritoneum).",

The extra calories you are getting can also cause high blood sugar, especially for those with diabetes. Holding fluid in your abdomen for extended time periods may even strain your muscles. Inadequate Dialysis. Peritoneal Dialysis can become ineffective after several years. You might need to switch to hemodialysis.

These results came from a new study on 6147 European and Argentinian patients receiving hemodialysis. The study defined physical activity as participating in activities like work, household chores, travel, or leisure. Heart-related deaths included sudden death, heart attack, atherosclerotic heart disease, cardiac arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, valvular heart disease, pulmonary edema, and congestive heart failure. Occasional physical activity was associated with a 20% lower risk for overall deaths and an 18% lower risk for heart-related deaths.",

Frequent physical activity was associated with an 18% lower risk for overall fatalities and a 23% lower risk for heart-related deaths. As physical activity increased, the risk of heart-related deaths significantly decreased. Investigators adjusted results for patients’ diets. These results show that even low levels of physical activities without risk of injuries can yield a positive effect on lowering the risk for death in these patients – Dr. Bernier-Jean’s team concluded during the study.

We are sharing some widespread myths and facts related to renal diet, which will assist you in formulating an effective, balanced diet strategy. Myth: There is only one renal diet that everyone on dialysis needs to follow. Fact: Everyone is unique, and that includes their dietary needs, which depend on some of the following: Stage of kidney disease. Lab results. Medications. Comorbidities like diabetes or high blood pressure. Lifestyle activities like exercising. Working with your healthcare team and renal dietitian is the best way to create the right diet plan for you. Myth: Whole grains, nuts, seeds, and beans have too much phosphorus. Fact: Whole grains, nuts, seeds, and beans contain phosphorus, but your body only absorbs 50% of phosphorus from non-processed, plant-based foods! You absorb 80-100% of phosphorus from protein-rich foods like meat, fish, and dairy or processed foods with phosphorus additives. Avoid phosphorus additives like Sodium hexametaphosphate, Dicalcium phosphate, Trisodium phosphate, Sodium tripolyphosphate, and Phosphoric acid.

Myth: People with kidney disease need a low-potassium diet. Fact: Individuals with kidney disease are often thought to need a low-potassium diet. However, it’s crucial to understand that they can face risks from both excessive and insufficient potassium levels, which can affect their heart rhythm. High potassium/hyperkalemia: Your blood potassium levels are too high. This means that you’ll need to eat lesser quantities of low-potassium foods. Your doctor may then prescribe or adjust medications to help your body release extra potassium. Low potassium/hypokalemia: Blood potassium levels are too low. If you have low potassium, you may need to eat more potassium or high-potassium foods. Your doctor may prescribe new or adjust old medications to maintain potassium levels better. Remember that sudden or severe hyperkalemia and hypokalemia are life-threatening conditions that need immediate medical care. Myth: I need to limit fruits and vegetables because of potassium. Fact: Even those who need to limit potassium need plenty of fruits and vegetables. Remember that less potassium is absorbed from plant-based foods than from meat-based or overly processed foods.",

    "content": "Myth: I need to limit fruits and vegetables because of potassium. Fact: Even those who need to limit potassium need plenty of fruits and vegetables. Remember that less potassium is absorbed from plant-based foods than from meat-based or overly processed foods. Fiber may also improve bowel regularity to increase overall potassium excretion and improve acidosis, which is a condition where body fluids have too much acid. Acidosis can cause kidney disease to progress more quickly, increased bone loss or osteoporosis, and muscle loss Myth: Salt substitutes are safer than salt. Fact: Too much sodium can cause high blood pressure, discomfort during dialysis, and fluid buildup around the heart and lungs. Salt substitutes contain potassium chloride. This could be dangerous, especially if you need to limit how much potassium you eat. If you choose low-sodium or any salt-free seasoning blends, always look at the label and choose ones without potassium chloride. Always check with your dietitian to see if it is okay to use. Myth: I don’t put salt in my food, so I don’t need to worry about sodium. Fact: Sodium is found in many foods other than your saltshaker.",

Fact: Sodium is found in many foods other than your saltshaker. High-sodium foods include breads, pizza, sandwiches, soups, tacos, condiments, snack foods, and deli meats (bacon, hot dogs, sausages, etc.). Make simple changes while grocery shopping, like trying unsalted or reduced-sodium foods and choosing fresh foods. Myth: Eating more salt will help with cramping during and after dialysis treatments. Fact: Common causes of dialysis muscle cramps include rapid or excessive fluid removal, low blood pressure during dialysis, and electrolyte imbalances. Cramping can be caused by high weight gain in between dialysis treatments, overly aggressive fluid removal, missing or not completing dialysis treatments, and eating too much salt. Tips for managing cramping include: Longer or more frequent treatments. Managing fluid gains between treatments by limiting sodium to 2000 mg or less daily. Following your fluid restriction of 32-48 oz/day. Completing all treatments as prescribed.",

Expanded dialysis is a new treatment method that can remove a broader range of toxins from the body than conventional dialysis. This study was conducted for three months with 28 patients. The new dialyzer used in the study has precisely made pores that allow larger-sized toxic chemicals to be filtered from the blood as well while retaining essential molecules such as albumin.",

    "content": "This study was conducted for three months with 28 patients. The new dialyzer used in the study has precisely made pores that allow larger-sized toxic chemicals to be filtered from the blood as well while retaining essential molecules such as albumin. The substances that can now be filtered out can cause inflammation, malnutrition, and chronic symptoms like fatigue if left in the body. Traditional dialysis treatments haven’t been as successful at removing these specific chemicals, and patients often report significant side effects. One of the study participants with chronic kidney disease had been on dialysis for about five years. He complained of reduced appetite, weakness, and reduced sleep quality previously. He reported feeling better, improved appetite, and improved sleep quality with expanded dialysis. With the first phase of this study completed and published in Kidney Medicine, the scientist will move on to the next stage. The next phase will be conducted with 60 dialysis patients for six months of treatments using the new dialyzer. The second phase will be a multicentered clinical study, simultaneously led by Lawson, University of Toronto, and Humber College.

The US Food and Drug Administration has asked for an additional clinical trial to demonstrate the benefits of Tenapanor before it approves the drug. Tenapanor has shown good prospects in trials to control serum phosphorus in adult individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on dialysis. Tenapanor is an oral drug that inhibits the sodium-proton exchanger NHE3. The drug was submitted for approval to treat hyperphosphatemia in patients with CKD on dialysis.",

Tenapanor is an oral drug that inhibits the sodium-proton exchanger NHE3. The drug was submitted for approval to treat hyperphosphatemia in patients with CKD on dialysis. The data is supported by three phase-3 clinical trials involving more than 1000 patients. The FDA stated that approval of the drug application would require the drug manufacturer to carry out another “adequate and well-controlled trial” that shows this treatment can have a meaningful impact on the level of phosphorus in the blood or improve a health issue caused by hyperphosphatemia in dialysis patients with chronic kidney disease. CKD Patients receiving dialysis treatments are highly likely to be hyperphosphatemic. Current Therapies for Hyperphosphatemia are only moderately effective and challenging to implement. Current strategies for managing hyperphosphatemia can include more frequent hemodialysis therapies, dietary phosphate restriction, and phosphate binder therapy. Untreated hyperphosphatemia in patients can lead to dystrophic calcification, accelerated arteriosclerotic vascular disease, and fractures. In the previous study, 236 dialysis patients with hyperphosphatemia, despite treatment with a phosphate binder therapy, were given 4 weeks of treatment.",

Due to this trend, the number of people who need renal replacement therapy is also on the rise. One of the major tasks of the kidneys is filtering the metabolites from the blood. If the kidneys can no longer perform this job, the blood must be cleansed and drained artificially through Dialysis (blood washing). Some patients choose the flexible method of Dialysis called peritoneal Dialysis (PD), which uses the peritoneum membrane as a filter. The advantage of peritoneal Dialysis is the flexibility it offers.",

The advantage of peritoneal Dialysis is the flexibility it offers. It can be performed independently at home, significantly improving quality of life. In addition, this vascular-sparing form of removing excess water and dissolved urinary substances can better preserve any remaining kidney function. The solution used during PD is a mixture of salt, minerals, and dextrose (sugar) dissolved in water, called dialysis solution, and is placed in a person’s abdominal cavity through a catheter. Peritoneal Dialysis-related infections, including peritonitis, exit‐site infections (ESI), and tunnel infections, are some of the complications resulting in significant morbidity and risk of death. Early complications related to peritoneal access are divided into mechanical (bleeding, visceral perforation, dialysate leaks, catheter dysfunction, hernia formation, cuff extrusion) and infectious (early peritonitis, surgical wound, tunnel, and exit site infections). Common Complications of Peritoneal Dialysis The most significant and commonly reported complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheters is an infection called Peritonitis. It is an infection of the abdominal cavity’s lining (peritoneum).",

Absorbing some dialysates might even cause you to take in hundreds of extra calories daily. This can easily lead to weight gain. The extra calories you are getting can also cause high blood sugar, especially for those with diabetes. Holding fluid in your abdomen for extended time periods may even strain your muscles. Inadequate Dialysis. Peritoneal Dialysis can become ineffective after several years. You might need to switch to hemodialysis. Protocols are in place to decrease the infection risk in PD patients and prevent complications of peritoneal dialysis.

These results came from a new study on 6147 European and Argentinian patients receiving hemodialysis. The study defined physical activity as participating in activities like work, household chores, travel, or leisure. Heart-related deaths included sudden death, heart attack, atherosclerotic heart disease, cardiac arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, valvular heart disease, pulmonary edema, and congestive heart failure. Occasional physical activity was associated with a 20% lower risk for overall deaths and an 18% lower risk for heart-related deaths.",

Occasional physical activity was associated with a 20% lower risk for overall deaths and an 18% lower risk for heart-related deaths. Frequent physical activity was associated with an 18% lower risk for overall fatalities and a 23% lower risk for heart-related deaths. As physical activity increased, the risk of heart-related deaths significantly decreased. Investigators adjusted results for patients’ diets. These results show that even low levels of physical activities without risk of injuries can yield a positive effect on lowering the risk for death in these patients – Dr. Bernier-Jean’s team concluded during the study.

    "content": "Starting on Dialysis Knowing what to expect helps you feel more comfortable with your new treatment routine when getting ready for dialysis. Before starting dialysis, your doctor will explain the different treatment options to you, and you can choose the one that works best for you and your lifestyle. Your care team will be there with you every step of the way, providing guidance and support during the planning, training, and learning process of dialysis, helping you to adapt and do well. What is DIalysis?Choosing the dialysis optionFrequently asked questions What is Dialysis? Choosing the dialysis option Frequently asked questions Menu What is Dialysis? Choosing the dialysis option Frequently asked questions What is Dialysis? Dialysis is generally started when your kidney function drops to 15% or less or if you have severe symptoms caused by your kidney disease. Shortness of breath, fatigue, muscle cramps, nausea, or vomiting are severe symptoms that may occur. When your kidneys cannot remove extra fluid and waste from the body, then dialysis is generally recommended.Your nephrologist will assist you in determining the appropriate time to begin dialysis, considering factors such as your remaining kidney function as determined by tests and your symptoms.",

It is advised to start preparing for dialysis well ahead of time, typically when your kidney disease progresses to stage 4, where the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) falls below 30 mL/min. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) often progresses slowly. Often, individuals are unaware of the extent of their discomfort until they commence dialysis, which can lead to a significant improvement in how they feel. To improve your well-being, it is crucial to adhere to the treatment plan recommended by your healthcare team, including doctors, nurses, dietitians, and social workers. Following their guidance can help you maintain the healthiest lifestyle possible. Choosing the dialysis option Selecting a dialysis option that suits your current way of life can enable you to continue enjoying the activities you love while keeping your health in check. Home peritoneal dialysis, home hemodialysis, or in-center dialysis are viable choices for most individuals.",

Home peritoneal dialysis, home hemodialysis, or in-center dialysis are viable choices for most individuals. Making an early decision allows for more preparation time and can contribute to a greater sense of control over your health. In-center hemodialysis With in-center hemodialysis (HD), you’ll typically go to the dialysis center thrice per week for about 3 to 5 hours per session to have your blood filtered, depending on your doctor’s schedule.

    "content": "Home hemodialysis With home hemodialysis (HD), you are connected via a needle in your access site to an artificial kidney (dialyzer) that filters your blood. Opting for home-based treatment gives you the flexibility to schedule your prescribed treatments according to your daily activities. Treating at home eliminates the need to travel to a treatment center, saving travel time and transportation expenses. Peritoneal dialysis Home peritoneal dialysis (PD) involves using the peritoneum and the lining of your abdomen to filter your blood. Unlike other forms of dialysis, PD does not require needles, and your blood remains inside your body throughout the process. One of the advantages of PD is its flexibility, allowing you to perform treatments in various settings such as your home, workplace, or even while traveling. Initiating PD at an early stage may contribute to preserving any remaining kidney function. Frequently asked questions Who pays for dialysis?

She understands that dialysis is hard and in-center dialysis takes extra accommodations, and this can be daunting to patients. Brittany recounts a specific instance where she had a patient undergoing in-center dialysis who was on the verge of giving up. This was a compelling incentive to help improve the patient’s mental well-being. Brittany provided consistent support throughout the treatment process, ensuring timely medication administration. Eventually, she transitioned the patient to home dialysis, significantly enhancing his perspective on the dialysis experience. She is determined to ensure that where there’s a will, there’s a way for her patients. Home dialysis offers patients a sense of having more time for their daily activities.

As medical technology evolved, so has my career with Kidney Care Center (KCC) and later Dialysis Care Center (DCC). Working in a dialysis center was not a career I saw for myself, but now I believe I was in the right place at the right time. I was introduced to dialysis as an intern at the Joliet clinic. At the time, I was studying to become a medical assistant. People ask me what drew me to work in dialysis care. It was a variety of work.",

The more I learn, the better I can understand and care for our patients. My passion and growing experience helped me advance from Medical Assistant to Dialysis Access Specialist, the position I hold today. While working in dialysis care has unique challenges, I have never stopped being an enthusiastic champion for my patients. The most important thing I can provide is a familiar face to patients, so they know they are not going through the treatment alone. Showing patients they have a support system behind them is one of the most rewarding aspects of the job. Reflecting on my ten years with KCC and DCC, I realize it has been quite a journey.",

We have raised over $25,000 and gathered hundreds of participants over the years. However, the real impact cannot be measured in dollars or numbers; it is seen in the faces of those walking and felt in the stories they share.For Emmanuel I., an IT Associate, it’s about unity and purpose. “I love seeing colleagues from different departments come together to stand for a common cause.”The same feeling is shared by Mirza B., Senior Director of IT. “I participate in the Kidney Walk each year to support our patients and stand alongside the incredible team at the Dialysis Care Center and Kidney Care Center. Seeing our employees, families, and community come together with a shared purpose is a powerful reminder of why we do what we do.”That shared purpose is what makes the Kidney Walk more than just a fundraiser or an awareness event.",

Kim R. walks for her dad, who was also a dialysis patient.Victoria V., Dialysis Outreach Liaison, does it for her family.

Andrea was a DCC Social Worker in our Georgia region starting in September 2021. In our eyes, Andrea Spraggins was a hero. What makes someone a hero? We define it as the person who uses their time on Earth to impact people’s lives positively. Remembered by those she worked with for her passion, Andrea dedicated her career to helping patients understand that dialysis is a part of their life, not their entire life.",

Remembered by those she worked with for her passion, Andrea dedicated her career to helping patients understand that dialysis is a part of their life, not their entire life. Andrea was an advocate for organ donation and worked tirelessly to make sure her patients understood the importance of being healthy and prepared for any opportunity. As a proud Delta Sigma Theta sorority member, Andrea was deeply involved in community service in the African American community. She brought her spirit and passion to everything she did at work and in her everyday life. Andrea joined the Dialysis Care Center family in September of 2021 as a Social Worker at the South Fulton and Hapeville, Georgia, locations. Throughout her time at DCC, Andrea always advocated to patients the importance of adjusting positively to life on dialysis and working hard to maintain their new lifestyles. She worked extensively with her co-worker Kim Birdsong to help educate patients on the importance of not missing dialysis treatments.",

Regarding Andrea’s talents, Birdsong said, “Working with patients is where Andrea’s talents were best exhibited, and she was always happy to share her experiences.” As an organ recipient, Andrea’s unique perspective helped her relate to patients personally. Social Worker Manager Dawn Gromley says that Andrea could relate to her patients in a way not everyone can. Andrea’s openness about her experiences made her a vital part of the team. Gromley also says that although Andrea’s time with DCC was beginning, she positively impacted the Social Work team. Although Andrea’s time at Dialysis Care Center was cut short, she will be remembered as a champion for her patients. We want to honor her memory and share what made Andrea a hero to those around her.

The patient’s vascular access in HHD allows blood to flow through a dialysis machine. This effectively cleans the blood by removing excess waste and fluids.

Self-cannulation Self-cannulation refers to the patient taking the initiative to insert their own dialysis needles. In the case of home hemodialysis (HHD), patients undergo training to learn how to perform self-cannulation, or they can have their care partners assist them with the needle insertion process. Although the idea of self-cannulation may initially appear intimidating, introducing techniques like the buttonhole technique has dramatically simplified and enhanced the comfort of self-cannulation. Some patients use the buttonhole for dialysis, which involves inserting needles into the same spot repeatedly, resulting in scar tissue formation and the creation of a hole similar to a pierced ear. With this method, patients can use blunt needles instead of sharp needles, which are more comfortable and safer.

In the case of home hemodialysis (HHD), patients undergo training to learn how to perform self-cannulation, or they can have their care partners assist them with the needle insertion process. Although the idea of self-cannulation may initially appear intimidating, the introduction of techniques like the buttonhole technique has greatly simplified and enhanced the comfort of self-cannulation.Some patients use the buttonhole for dialysis which involves inserting needles into the same spot repeatedly, resulting in scar tissue formation and the creation of a hole similar to a pierced ear.With this method, patients can use blunt needles instead of sharp needles, which are more comfortable and safer for the patient.

PD uses your own abdomen (belly) lining to help remove the waste buildup. This is done with a solution known as dialysate. Instead of using needles, a surgically placed tube called a catheter is used to pass dialysate in and out of the abdomen. This soft and flexible catheter, approximately the width of a pencil, can be discreetly hidden under clothing while going about daily activities.",

Opting for home-based treatment gives you the flexibility to schedule your prescribed treatments according to your daily activities. Treating at home eliminates the need to travel to a treatment center, saving travel time and transportation expenses. Peritoneal dialysis Home peritoneal dialysis (PD) involves using the peritoneum and the lining of your abdomen to filter your blood. Unlike other forms of dialysis, PD does not require needles, and your blood remains inside your body throughout the process. One of the advantages of PD is its flexibility, allowing you to perform treatments in various settings such as your home, workplace, or even while traveling. Initiating PD at an early stage may contribute to preserving any remaining kidney function. Frequently asked questions Who pays for dialysis?
