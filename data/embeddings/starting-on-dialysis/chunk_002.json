  "content": "Choosing the dialysis option Selecting a dialysis option that suits your current way of life can enable you to continue enjoying the activities you love while keeping your health in check. Home peritoneal dialysis, home hemodialysis, or in-center dialysis are viable choices for most individuals. Making an early decision allows for more preparation time and can contribute to a greater sense of control over your health. In-center hemodialysis With in-center hemodialysis (HD), you’ll typically go to the dialysis center thrice per week for about 3 to 5 hours per session to have your blood filtered, depending on your doctor’s schedule. Throughout your treatment, a needle will be used to connect you to an artificial kidney (dialyzer) through your access site. Your healthcare team will closely monitor and oversee the entire dialysis process, ensuring that you have all the necessary support and resources you require. Home hemodialysis With home hemodialysis (HD), you are connected via a needle in your access site to an artificial kidney (dialyzer) that filters your blood. Opting for home-based treatment gives you the flexibility to schedule your prescribed treatments according to your daily activities.",
