  "content": "Dialysis patients need to have a great relationship with their dietitians, and having open lines of communication is crucial to receiving the best patient care. Be honest with your dietitian if you struggle to navigate the renal diet or feel overwhelmed with everything else in your life – they are here to help guide your nutrition decisions. Use March and National Nutrition Month as a time to reflect on the nutrition goals that you have set for the year. Have you been forgetting to take your binder? Have you been overeating fast food recently? Noticing that you aren’t monitoring fluid intake between treatments? Talk to your renal dietitian and devise a plan to crush your nutrition goals! Happy National Nutrition Month! Take time to thank your fantastic dietitian this month.",
