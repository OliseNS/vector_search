  "content": "Instead of using needles, a surgically placed tube called a catheter is used to pass dialysate in and out of the abdomen. This soft and flexible catheter, approximately the width of a pencil, can be discreetly hidden under clothing while going about daily activities. The process involves the fluid drawing waste from the blood and exiting the body through the catheter over several hours. Since peritoneal dialysis (PD) treatments can be performed multiple times a day, it closely resembles the natural function of the kidneys. The catheter remains permanently in the abdomen and is secured outside the body with tape, allowing individuals to continue their everyday tasks such as work recreation, taking a shower, sexual activity, and exercise without interference. Transitioning from in-center dialysis to PDMany people starting with an in-center dialysis treatment might eventually switch to at-home dialysis treatment.",
