  "content": "If you have an infection, it can be treated at home with antibiotics. You are also more likely to get a kidney transplant in the U.S. than to be at risk of peritonitis infection. PD is very time-consuming. PD may allow you to spend time with family and friends, at work, or do what you love the most â€“ because, with this option, you can have dialysis treatment outside of a dialysis center. PD is not a viable option for individuals who are overweight, muscular, or tall. PD is mostly suited for patients with a larger body mass. Studies show that death and infection rates are similar for people with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who have a raised body mass and are on PD than those on in-center hemodialysis (HD). PD is not suitable for people who have disabilities. Although PD may be more challenging for people with specific disabilities (blindness, deafness, amputation, etc. ), this treatment may still be an option. Performing PD with the help of a care partner and/or specialized equipment is often feasible. Training and safety programs are available to provide education on safely and effectively performing treatments for the patient and their care partner.",
