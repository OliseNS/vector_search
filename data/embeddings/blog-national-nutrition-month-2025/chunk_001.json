Proper nutrition is essential for managing potassium, phosphorus, sodium, and fluid intake while on dialysis. Dietary restrictions can feel limiting, but with the proper guidance, meals can still bring joy and cultural connection. Registered Dietitian Nutritionists (RDNs) play a vital role in helping dialysis patients navigate these needs.",
