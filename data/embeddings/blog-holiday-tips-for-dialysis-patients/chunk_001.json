  "content": "Take binders with all meals and snacks to keep your heart and bones healthy. Don’t miss your dialysis appointments, as regular appointments help remove toxins and fluids better. Limit high-potassium foods and select low-potassium options to protect your heart. Limit foods high in potassium, like nuts, oranges, dried fruit, and chocolate. Peel, dice, and boil potatoes to lower the potassium content. Choose low-phosphorus desserts without nuts and chocolate. Use herbs, spices, and unsalted seasonings to create your dressings/fillings and sauces to reduce salt/sodium content. Choose hot cider or cold ginger ale, and limit high-phosphorus eggnog and hot chocolate. Avoid processed meat like ham and sausages, and choose unprocessed meat like roast beef, turkey, chicken, or pork tenderloin. Prefer homemade dressings & gravy, leached potatoes, and rice and rolls while going easy on mac & cheese, sweet potatoes/yams, potato salad, boxed stuffing, and canned gravy. Inform your dialysis team of any travel plans or unscheduled appointments so you don’t forget your treatment.",
