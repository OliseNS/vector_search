  "content": "For Dialysis Care Center and Kidney Care Center, it’s more than just a walk – it’s a tradition built on love, remembrance, and the drive to make a difference.Why We WalkTeam Care has participated in the Kidney Walk since 2018. We have raised over $25,000 and gathered hundreds of participants over the years. However, the real impact cannot be measured in dollars or numbers; it is seen in the faces of those walking and felt in the stories they share.For Emmanuel I., an IT Associate, it’s about unity and purpose. “I love seeing colleagues from different departments come together to stand for a common cause.”The same feeling is shared by Mirza B., Senior Director of IT. “I participate in the Kidney Walk each year to support our patients and stand alongside the incredible team at the Dialysis Care Center and Kidney Care Center. Seeing our employees, families, and community come together with a shared purpose is a powerful reminder of why we do what we do.”That shared purpose is what makes the Kidney Walk more than just a fundraiser or an awareness event.",
