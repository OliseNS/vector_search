It’s a message of action and a lifeline of support for people with kidney disease.Walking in MemoryFor Ganiat B., Senior Accountant at DCC Corporate, every step is a tribute.“I participate in the Kidney Walk to honor my dad. He was on dialysis for 13 years before he passed away. I walk every year to keep his memory alive.”She’s one of many on Team Care who walk in memory of a loved one. Janet P. remembers her father with every walk. Annette G. walks in honor of her uncle. Kim R. walks for her dad, who was also a dialysis patient.Victoria V., Dialysis Outreach Liaison, does it for her family. She explains, “I’m motivated to walk each year because kidney failure has affected my family and two close friends. I walk for my mother!”These moments of remembrance bring comfort and quiet strength.",
