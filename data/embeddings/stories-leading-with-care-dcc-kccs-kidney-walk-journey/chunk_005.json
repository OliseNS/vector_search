The energy is joyful but grounded in real stories and real struggles.The Heart Behind the WalkEvery year, Ning R., Director of Marketing and Outreach, leads Team Care’s Kidney Walk. Her dedication is a significant part of what makes the walk possible.“What excites and motivates me to coordinate the Kidney Walk each year is the direct impact it has on people’s lives,” she said. “I’m inspired by the resilience of kidney patients and their families.”For Ning, this goes beyond logistics. It’s about supporting people on their journey.“The walk is a way to raise awareness, build community, and support patient services. It reminds people that they’re not alone. It’s more than just an event. It’s a movement.”Her dedication ensures that each year, Team Care not only participates but does so with strength, knowledge, and a commitment to taking action.",
