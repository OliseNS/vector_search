  "content": "You may think, what’s the big deal if I miss one, two, or even three treatments? Skipping dialysis treatments or cutting your treatments short can be very dangerous for your health. The amount of time and how often you need dialysis is determined by your nephrologist to meet your individual needs. Getting adequate dialysis ensures that toxins and excess fluids are being removed from your body so that you can stay healthy. When you skip treatments or terminate treatments early, additional fluid will need to be removed at your next dialysis treatment, which can cause uncomfortable symptoms such as cramping, headaches, low blood pressure, or nausea as we try to get you back to your dry weight. You may also feel shortness of breath, which can lead to hospitalization due to fluid overload. Aside from fluid removal, the kidneys are also responsible for managing your blood pressure and keeping a safe balance of key minerals, such as potassium and phosphorus. High potassium can lead to heart problems, including irregular heartbeat, heart attack, and death. High phosphorus can weaken your bones and increase your risk for heart disease. It’s not worth the risk!",
