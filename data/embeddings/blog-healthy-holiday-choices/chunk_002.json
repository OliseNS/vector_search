  "content": "Ensure you include plenty of lean proteins throughout the day to avoid overeating during the holiday celebrations. Choose healthier alternatives Avoid nuts, chocolate, or hot cocoa, as these foods are high in phosphorus. Pumpkin and sweet potato pie are high in potassium. Instead, try a slice of fruit pie like apple or blueberry. Jell-O, fruit sherbet, or a small slice of fruit cake are also great dessert options! If you plan to serve a potato dish, try double-boiled mashed potatoes, as this cooking method will remove a lot of potassium. Try sticking to Â½ cup portions for dishes that are higher in potassium or phosphorus. Watch out for salt! Going over your sodium restriction this time of year can be very easy. Avoid or limit gravies, chips, and prepackaged crackers. When seasoning meats, avoid basting and use spices like chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, paprika, and olive oil to help flavor your food without adding salt. Lemon and herbs like rosemary, tarragon, and oregano are complimentary seasonings. Avoid stress and make time for yourself Holidays can become very hectic with all the social gatherings happening simultaneously.",
