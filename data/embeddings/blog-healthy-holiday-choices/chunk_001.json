  "content": "Whatever holidays you celebrate, this is a time that many enjoy their favorite foods. But we still need to be mindful of our food choices. Here are some helpful reminders to enjoy your favorite cultural foods during this time of year! Be mindful of food and drink choices It can be very easy to let loose when celebrating the holidays. Since you are on dialysis, it is essential to remember your renal diet fundamentals. Talk to your doctor about alcohol. It should be consumed modestly based on your overall fluid intake and medications. If they advise against it, choose sugar-free lemon-lime soda, ginger ale, sparkling cider, or low-potassium juices like apple, grape, or cranberry juice. It is imperative to bring your phosphorus binder to all of your holiday get-togethers if you are having holiday dinner with others. Use small plates to help control your food portions, and avoid snacking throughout the day. Ensure you include plenty of lean proteins throughout the day to avoid overeating during the holiday celebrations. Choose healthier alternatives Avoid nuts, chocolate, or hot cocoa, as these foods are high in phosphorus. Pumpkin and sweet potato pie are high in potassium.",
