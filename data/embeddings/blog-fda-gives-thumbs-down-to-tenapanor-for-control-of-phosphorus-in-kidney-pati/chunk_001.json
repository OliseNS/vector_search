The US Food and Drug Administration has asked for an additional clinical trial to demonstrate the benefits of Tenapanor before it approves the drug. Tenapanor has shown good prospects in trials to control serum phosphorus in adult individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on dialysis. Tenapanor is an oral drug that inhibits the sodium-proton exchanger NHE3. The drug was submitted for approval to treat hyperphosphatemia in patients with CKD on dialysis. The data is supported by three phase-3 clinical trials involving more than 1000 patients.",
