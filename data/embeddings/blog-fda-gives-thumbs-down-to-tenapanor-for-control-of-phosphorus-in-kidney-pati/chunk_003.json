  "content": "In the previous study, 236 dialysis patients with hyperphosphatemia, despite treatment with a phosphate binder therapy, were given 4 weeks of treatment. The treatment included either the twice-daily oral Tenapanor or a placebo dose. The results showed that the drug treatment group significantly changed serum phosphorus concentration over placebo. Tenapanor previously received FDA approval in 2019 to treat irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with constipation in adults.
