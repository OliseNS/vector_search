  "content": "Always check with your dietitian to see if it is okay to use. Myth: I don’t put salt in my food, so I don’t need to worry about sodium. Fact: Sodium is found in many foods other than your saltshaker. High-sodium foods include breads, pizza, sandwiches, soups, tacos, condiments, snack foods, and deli meats (bacon, hot dogs, sausages, etc.). Make simple changes while grocery shopping, like trying unsalted or reduced-sodium foods and choosing fresh foods. Myth: Eating more salt will help with cramping during and after dialysis treatments. Fact: Common causes of dialysis muscle cramps include rapid or excessive fluid removal, low blood pressure during dialysis, and electrolyte imbalances. Cramping can be caused by high weight gain in between dialysis treatments, overly aggressive fluid removal, missing or not completing dialysis treatments, and eating too much salt. Tips for managing cramping include: Longer or more frequent treatments. Managing fluid gains between treatments by limiting sodium to 2000 mg or less daily. Following your fluid restriction of 32-48 oz/day. Completing all treatments as prescribed.",
