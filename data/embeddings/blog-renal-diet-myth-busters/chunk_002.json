Myth: People with kidney disease need a low-potassium diet. Fact: Individuals with kidney disease are often thought to need a low-potassium diet. However, it’s crucial to understand that they can face risks from both excessive and insufficient potassium levels, which can affect their heart rhythm. High potassium/hyperkalemia: Your blood potassium levels are too high. This means that you’ll need to eat lesser quantities of low-potassium foods. Your doctor may then prescribe or adjust medications to help your body release extra potassium. Low potassium/hypokalemia: Blood potassium levels are too low. If you have low potassium, you may need to eat more potassium or high-potassium foods. Your doctor may prescribe new or adjust old medications to maintain potassium levels better. Remember that sudden or severe hyperkalemia and hypokalemia are life-threatening conditions that need immediate medical care. Myth: I need to limit fruits and vegetables because of potassium. Fact: Even those who need to limit potassium need plenty of fruits and vegetables. Remember that less potassium is absorbed from plant-based foods than from meat-based or overly processed foods.",
