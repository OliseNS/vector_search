  "content": "Foods high in saturated fat include butter, red meat, whole milk, cheese, ice cream, and tropical oils like coconut and palm. Trans-fats are a different story and should be consumed minimally. Foods high in trans fat include margarine, fried foods, vegetable shortening, highly processed foods, and baked goods. When grocery shopping, read food labels and avoid “partially hydrogenated oils.” Choose these foods less often and replace them with foods high in unsaturated fats. Include More Fiber in Your Diet We all know fiber is essential for our gut health and helps to keep our bowel movement regular, but did you know it can also be good for your heart? Including more fiber in your diet helps remove the bad cholesterol and can help lower the risk of heart disease! Kidney-friendly fiber foods include raspberries, blueberries, apples, peaches, asparagus, corn, cabbage, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, carrots, and tangerines. Remember that high-fiber foods can be high in potassium and phosphorus. Ask your renal dietitian about high-fiber foods you can include in your renal diet.",
