  "content": "Valentine’s Day is designed to show appreciation and gratitude towards our loved ones. While it is important to share love with others, it is equally important to remember to share that love with yourself and your heart! Heart health is essential for this month and the rest of the year. Incorporate Healthy Fats into Your Diet Foods rich in unsaturated fats reduce LDL “bad” cholesterol levels and improve overall heart health. There are only two types of unsaturated fats – monounsaturated and polyunsaturated. Examples of monounsaturated fats are canola oil, peanut oil, avocado oil, and olive oil. Use these oils for sautéing, lightly pan frying, as a dip for bread, dressing for a salad, or as the base of marinades for heart-healthy proteins like chicken, fish, and tofu. Monounsaturated fats can also be found in potassium-rich foods like avocados, nuts, and seeds. Refer to your dietitian for guidance on including these foods in your diet. Omega-3 fatty acids, shown to lower the risk of heart disease, are found in foods rich in polyunsaturated fats like salmon, tuna, flaxseeds, and fish oil supplements.",
