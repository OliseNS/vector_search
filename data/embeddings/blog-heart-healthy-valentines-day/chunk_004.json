  "content": "Kidney-friendly fiber foods include raspberries, blueberries, apples, peaches, asparagus, corn, cabbage, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, carrots, and tangerines. Remember that high-fiber foods can be high in potassium and phosphorus. Ask your renal dietitian about high-fiber foods you can include in your renal diet. Control Fluid and Salt Intake As always, limiting salt and fluid intake is extremely important, as consuming too much can cause your body to hold onto extra fluid, leading to shortness of breath. When you are short of breath for a prolonged period, it makes your heart work harder than it should. Fluid limits are individualized and determined by swelling, weight gain between treatments, and if you can still urinate. When grocery shopping, read food labels and avoid consuming over 2,000 mg of sodium daily. Reduce Stressors and Take Time to Love Yourself Yes, stress can decrease your overall heart health! It’s important to note that experiencing continuous feelings of anger, sadness, or anxiety can have negative impacts on your overall health, both physically and mentally. Additionally, it can lead to undue stress on your heart. Talk to your social worker about ways to cope with stress and resources that can help reduce your life’s stressors.",
