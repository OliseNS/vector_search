Individuals on dialysis often need to restrict the amount of phosphorus they eat and drink. This is because the kidneys can no longer eliminate excess amounts of phosphorus consumed, and dialysis alone cannot remove all the phosphorus from your blood. High phosphorus levels can cause itching, weak and brittle bones, fractures, and hardening of the arteries. Dialysis patientsâ€™ average blood phosphorus level is between 3.5 and 5.5 mg/dl. To keep phosphorus levels within this range, most people will need to limit high-phosphorus items in their diet and take their phosphorus binders as prescribed.",
