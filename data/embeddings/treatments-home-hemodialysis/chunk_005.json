Care partners Most home hemodialysis (HHD) patients require a care partner (trained caregiver) to assist them during the dialysis process.Responsibilities of a care partner may include setting up the dialysis machine, monitoring the treatment, and cleaning the machine after dialysis sessions.The role of a care partner varies depending on the specific needs of the patient.Care partners undergo the same training as patients to ensure they are equipped to provide appropriate assistance. Self-cannulation Self-cannulation refers to the patient taking the initiative to insert their own dialysis needles.
