The responsibilities of a care partner may include setting up the dialysis machine, monitoring the treatment, and cleaning the machine after dialysis sessions. The role of a care partner varies depending on the patientâ€™s specific needs. Care partners undergo the same training as patients to ensure they can provide appropriate assistance.
