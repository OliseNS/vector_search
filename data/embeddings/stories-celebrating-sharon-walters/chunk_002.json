  "content": "Initially working for Home Dialysis Services, Walters enjoyed working in the home program and going to patients’ homes to help them with their treatment. Walters says that gaining patients’ trust in the home programs is essential because they invite you into their homes. People who work in home programs need to understand that responsibility and take it seriously. When HDS changed to DCC, Walters stayed on and helped with the transition to opening the clinic. Walters has been with Dialysis Care Center for nearly seven years and attributes her longevity with the company to the teamwork in her clinic. The teamwork between the different departments is something Walters enjoys about working at DCC. On her team, Walters said, “It is nice to have a team that will be there for you and pick up slack when you need it.",
