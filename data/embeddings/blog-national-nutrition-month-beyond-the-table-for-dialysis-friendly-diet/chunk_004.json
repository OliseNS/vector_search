  "content": "A dietitian can help you create sustainable healthy habits that suit your unique needs! Customized Nutrition Guidance: RDNs work alongside your healthcare team to ensure your dietary plan complements your treatment strategy. Lab Results Analysis: They analyze your lab results to fine-tune dietary recommendations and bone medications. Cultural Considerations: Recommend therapeutic diets considering your cultural preferences and changes in treatment based on your nutritional needs in consultation with your physician. Counseling and Monitoring: RDNs can guide you and your family/caregiver and monitor your adherence and response to dietary interventions. Resource Referral: If needed, the RDNs can connect you with resources like financial aid and community support. Information Support: Registered dietitian nutritionists are available to address nutritional status, bone health, and fluid management queries. This year’s theme reminds us of the broader impact of our food choices, especially for those on dialysis. Let’s embrace sustainable practices that align with our dietary needs, making mindful choices that nourish both the body and the planet. Together, let’s march beyond the table, ensuring a healthier, more fulfilling life for all.",
