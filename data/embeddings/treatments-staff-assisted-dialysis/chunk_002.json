During home dialysis, it will be your responsibility to manage your treatments, but you will also need to choose a care partner who can provide support throughout the process. A care partner is typically someone like a spouse, family member, or close friend.When you choose home dialysis, you will need to have a care partner, usually a spouse, family member, or close friend, to support you during the treatment. While having someone by your side can be comforting, it also means depending on someone else for your care, which might make you feel guilty. However, you don’t need a care partner with staff-assisted home dialysis. A licensed nurse will administer your treatment and provide the necessary support, ensuring you are always under the supervision of a doctor. You can always have your family continue to support you, but you won’t need to take up as much of their time. What Your Dialysis Schedule Looks Like?",
